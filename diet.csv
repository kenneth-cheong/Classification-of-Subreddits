I'm an 18-year-old female. When I was 15 and a half, I started counting calories. I did this until today. I was never overweight, but just unfit-looking. I started with ~1,500 calorie diet, and I am now sticking to 1,300 calories  (which I followed for a good portion when I was younger). There were time periods or a couple of months or so where I went off the tracks and lost progress, and had to start over. That's why it's taken me such a long time to lose the weight and keep it off. Consistent diet periods were 4 months upwards.

I remember reading somewhere that the required minimum intake for teenagers is 1,600 calories a day. I pretended I never read that back then because I really wanted to lose weight, but now I'm worried if I've actually affected my hormones or my growth. I'm 5'2"" (and now 117 lbs) and I haven't grown taller since I was 15. I also have pretty small A cup breasts that haven't changed much either. Now I know that some girls are just like that even if they grow in a healthy way, but I'm worried that this has been the result of my dieting.

I have been trying to lose weight lately to feel better about my own body but no diets plan are working for me so far so I am wondering if there's any advice / recommendation I can get from you guys.

My BMI is completely normal, but I feel a little chubby here and there, especially around my thighs and stomach area, so I am hoping to lose some weight to look better for myself when I look in the mirror. I'm 20 y/o, was a professional athlete, so I used to have big muscles around my thighs, shoulders and arms.

I workout every day and keep my calories intake around 1000kcal per day (I am not a big eater) but no progress has shown on the scale or mirror in the past months. So I am wondering if there is any diet plan / fasting plan or any routine at all that you personally tried/have been trying works for you? And can I mix different diet plans in different weeks, or do I have to stick to just one for a while? I am looking for any plans and routine that are healthy and efficient.

Even though I know it&amp;#39;s not healthy, and I have been taking steps towards eating more and not weighing myself as often, the paranoia will not go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been about two months since I have stepped on a scale, and I recently traveled across the world for the summer, and I have tried many different kinds of foods and eaten a lot more than I would normally feel comfortable doing. I am not really sure about what I should be doing for my diet to make sure I am not going to lose my mind the next time I step on a scale. I am honestly terrified about the thought of stepping on a scale because it has been so long. I go to the gym at least 4-5x per week to try to ease my mind but the thought will not stop lingering and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

i learned about a diet starter on German public TV. And i thought it's worth sharing, as i didn't hear about this in English media. Its based on the idea of getting rid of sugar addiction before actually starting a diet. Sugar addiction is what most people call ""Cravings"". Its an actual addiction that makes you want to eat. Its based on the simple fact that you can get addicted to the sugar-high after eating/drinking specific carbohydrates and sugar. You can read more about that [here](https://www.sweetdefeat.com/blog/sugar-addiction). 

The following sources are german.

This diet-starter combines this with [the knowledge](https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2006-943783) that simple Oat-flakes are able to improve your insulin sensitivity if taken in correctly. Similar diets are used in treating Diabetes Mellitus since more then a hundred years and were developed by Carl von Noorden, a German pathologist who opened the first clinic with a focus on treating diabetes. I have heard from this diet for the first time in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCyYTr8sf1c). It's from German public TV(=free of ads and state-funded) and done with the help of doctors and nutrition exports. 

So the promise of this diet-starter is: it increases insulin sensitivity, which is important for Type 2 diabetics, by eating primarily oat-flakes over the course of three days. And it should help to end your cravings. And my experience is: it works extremely well. Getting through this 3 days was not as hard as i thought. And after this 3 days i had no cravings left at all. Quite the opposite. I just didn't want to eat much any more. Eating too much - especially fat stuff - made me feel physically unwell. So i reduced my portion size because i felt *full*, not because i thought i should stop eating. Very different from any other diet, that often leaves you hungry and starving. It gave me a real chance to change my eating behaviour. And it was also extremely cheap. 

Blood sugar also looked very good after those 3 days. I'm not a diabetic, but my doctor said in my yearly check-up that my levels are getting higher and closer to the point where I'd need medication. 

I recommend doing this in your holidays, as it's pretty hard to do this during work-days. 

I started with buying ingredients. 

For the low-fat broth(alternative bouillion but be aware: boring taste makes every diet harder) i needed: 

- 500g-750g chicken pieces with bones(skin and fat removed) 
- 2 carrots, 
- 1 leek, 
- a small celery, 
- I also add the bad parts from the other veggies. The hard part of the broccoli. The upper part of garlic(looks like leek), the hard part of the fennel. You get the idea.

For the oat-flake ""stews"": 

- 1 kilo of oat flakes(the thin, flaky ones). 
- 500g meat. lean beef, chicken breast, prawns, scallops, squid. Whatever you like.
- a big load of fresh parsley,
- 2 lemons with edible skin, 
- fresh garlic,
- 2 zucchini,
- 1 broccoli,
- mushrooms,
- fennel
- and other sugar free veggies you like. 
- Also: a small junk of butter. The higher the quality, the better the taste. I use fresh sour-cream-based butter from happy cows with a distinctive cows-ass+grass flavour. 

I start with a broth. I remove all visible fat and skin from those chicken pieces. I add all the bones with all carrot, leek, celery, a bit of garlic and thyme into a large pot and fill it with water. I cook it - after it boiled once - on low heat for around 3 hours to make a nice, fat free broth. Tip: Put in salt at the end. The broth will taste richer. 

I also prepare the lemon ""Moroccan""-style. You can ignore this step if you hate lemon. Cut it into rough slices, put them into a zip bag add in 2-3 tablespoons of salt. Then mix it well and put it into the fridge at least 3 hours before you use it. Yes, its a lot of salt. It will suck out the bitterness, soften it up and concentrate the lemon flavour. I use this for seasoning as it goes very well with the butter/oatflakes/chicken-mix. 

The daily meals consist out of 3 portions. For each portion you are allowed to add 100-150g veggies/herbs/garlic, around 50g chicken meat and a half teaspoon of butter. A very small piece. **Note:** the original diet is without any meat. I add lean, fat free chicken/beef/prawns, because it tastes a lot better and because i think a bit of protein is necessary for a balanced diet. For each day you need 250g oat flakes. I split the flakes up into one main course with 100g and two 75g courses. Eat the big portion at the time you normally eat the most.

**A example preparation is:** chop up ~150g of veggies like zucchini, fennel, 2 mushrooms, garlic and/or broccoli. Also 2-3 lemon slices from the prepared lemon(finely chopped) and some parsley. Cut around half a breast or a half leg into small pieces. Use a small pot, put in butter, add in the chopped veggies and roast them on not too high heat until they get a bit of colour. Then add in around 200ml of broth and some thyme and let it cook until your veggies are how you like them and then add the meat and the lemon. When it cooks again and the meat is done: add the oat flakes. They are done almost instantly. Add in some more broth if needed. Give it a nice stir and take it from the heat. Check if you need salt, also add some pepper. Enjoy your meal. 

You can vary the meat with lean beef, prawns, scallops, squid and other lean meat. However you vary the dish: don't add sugar, cream or milk, and never any fat beside the small piece of butter. 

After this 3 days you can start with any diet you want. I prefer counting calories(~1500kcal). It works pretty great for me. If you are a diabetic it's recommended to add one or two of these oat-flake-days per week to improve your insulin sensitivity.

A nice general tip for diet: Try to eat with chop sticks or the wrong hand(left hand if you are right handed. This makes you eat slower and feeling full earlier.

I have heard from this diet for the first time in this &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCyYTr8sf1c""&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s from German public TV(=free of ads and state-funded) and done with the help of doctors and nutrition exports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the promise of this diet-starter is: it increases insulin sensitivity, which is important for Type 2 diabetics, by eating primarily oat-flakes over the course of three days. And it should help to end your cravings. And my experience is: it works extremely well. Getting through this 3 days was not as hard as i thought. And after this 3 days i had no cravings left at all. Quite the opposite. I just didn&amp;#39;t want to eat much any more. Eating too much - especially fat stuff - made me feel physically unwell. So i reduced my portion size because i felt &lt;em&gt;full&lt;/em&gt;, not because i thought i should stop eating. Very different from any other diet, that often leaves you hungry and starving. It gave me a real chance to change my eating behaviour. And it was also extremely cheap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood sugar also looked very good after those 3 days. I&amp;#39;m not a diabetic, but my doctor said in my yearly check-up that my levels are getting higher and closer to the point where I&amp;#39;d need medication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend doing this in your holidays, as it&amp;#39;s pretty hard to do this during work-days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with buying ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the low-fat broth(alternative bouillion but be aware: boring taste makes every diet harder) i needed: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500g-750g chicken pieces with bones(skin and fat removed) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 carrots, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 leek, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a small celery, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also add the bad parts from the other veggies. The hard part of the broccoli. The upper part of garlic(looks like leek), the hard part of the fennel. You get the idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the oat-flake &amp;quot;stews&amp;quot;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 kilo of oat flakes(the thin, flaky ones). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500g meat. lean beef, chicken breast, prawns, scallops, squid. Whatever you like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a big load of fresh parsley,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 lemons with edible skin, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fresh garlic,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 zucchini,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 broccoli,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mushrooms,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fennel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and other sugar free veggies you like. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also: a small junk of butter. The higher the quality, the better the taste. I use fresh sour-cream-based butter from happy cows with a distinctive cows-ass+grass flavour. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start with a broth. I remove all visible fat and skin from those chicken pieces. I add all the bones with all carrot, leek, celery, a bit of garlic and thyme into a large pot and fill it with water. I cook it - after it boiled once - on low heat for around 3 hours to make a nice, fat free broth. Tip: Put in salt at the end. The broth will taste richer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also prepare the lemon &amp;quot;Moroccan&amp;quot;-style. You can ignore this step if you hate lemon. Cut it into rough slices, put them into a zip bag add in 2-3 tablespoons of salt. Then mix it well and put it into the fridge at least 3 hours before you use it. Yes, its a lot of salt. It will suck out the bitterness, soften it up and concentrate the lemon flavour. I use this for seasoning as it goes very well with the butter/oatflakes/chicken-mix. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The daily meals consist out of 3 portions. For each portion you are allowed to add 100-150g veggies/herbs/garlic, around 50g chicken meat and a half teaspoon of butter. A very small piece. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; the original diet is without any meat. I add lean, fat free chicken/beef/prawns, because it tastes a lot better and because i think a bit of protein is necessary for a balanced diet. For each day you need 250g oat flakes. I split the flakes up into one main course with 100g and two 75g courses. Eat the big portion at the time you normally eat the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A example preparation is:&lt;/strong&gt; chop up ~150g of veggies like zucchini, fennel, 2 mushrooms, garlic and/or broccoli. Also 2-3 lemon slices from the prepared lemon(finely chopped) and some parsley. Cut around half a breast or a half leg into small pieces. Use a small pot, put in butter, add in the chopped veggies and roast them on not too high heat until they get a bit of colour. Then add in around 200ml of broth and some thyme and let it cook until your veggies are how you like them and then add the meat and the lemon. When it cooks again and the meat is done: add the oat flakes. They are done almost instantly. Add in some more broth if needed. Give it a nice stir and take it from the heat. Check if you need salt, also add some pepper. Enjoy your meal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can vary the meat with lean beef, prawns, scallops, squid and other lean meat. However you vary the dish: don&amp;#39;t add sugar, cream or milk, and never any fat beside the small piece of butter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this 3 days you can start with any diet you want. I prefer counting calories(~1500kcal). It works pretty great for me. If you are a diabetic it&amp;#39;s recommended to add one or two of these oat-flake-days per week to improve your insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nice general tip for diet: Try to eat with chop sticks or the wrong hand(left hand if you are right handed. This makes you eat slower and feeling full earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

I know this is not the way to lose fat in any means.

But, what if I stopped eating completely for 4 out 7 days a week? 
Only drinking water and taking multivitamins.

Obviously that would burn my fat deposits, but if I eat again on the 5th day will my body just put everything I eat back as fat?

What health risks should stop me from doing this type of diet? I am 6ft 102kg, not fat but not lean.

I've been fasting for 4 months or so now, this is the same thing but just more extreme in my eyes.

It is also strict on time, involving and intermittent fasting schedule of an 8 hour feeding window followed by a 16 hour fast and should be incorporated with a 4-5 day a week weight training routine. Proportions are based on weight and goals, you can use myfitnesspal and an online weight gain/loss calculator to customize the diet for yourself. Also, quiting smoking cigs and drinking alcohol are also recommended with micro doses of Gabby (once a week), Molly, (once a month w/ 1 Kiwi Fruit), Lucy (once a quarter), and Kelly (once a year) as replacements if needed. You can vape Mary everyday. It may seem daunting, but you&amp;#39;ll find its easy after two weeks and discover the convenience of little to no prep time. This diet is around 3,486 calories, with 150g of protein.&lt;/p&gt;

At first, my mother and I were skeptical but my mother decided to try it anyway. When my mother became slimmer as a result of the program, I decided to take part in it myself. The fact that my blood test results improved after eating the same kinds of food that she ate while she followed the 90-day long Wildfit program was another reason why I decided to follow it myself. Among the things that I had to cut out while following the program were refined sugar, wheat products and milk products.

As I followed the program, I realized the full extent of the negative effects that come from eating excess carbohydrates, refined sugar being the worst of all. I can say with the certainty of personal experience, and losing 10kg of weight, that refined sugar is a major contributor of obesity and is in fact even worse than fat. Sadly, a lot of commercial food products have sugar added and it is no exaggeration to say that refined sugar consumption is a serious personal healthcare issue. After all, it is a well-known fact that excess consumption of sugar causes diabetes and obesity.

Wheat is also another source of carbohydrates and is one of the ""empty carbs"" food items which can make you fat. While it may not be not as obesity-inducing as refined sugar, it can cause excess mucus production. I should know because I started coughing out mucus when I had some bread after following the Wildfit program. No matter how nice bread tastes, I cannot ignore the fact that it will make me cough out mucus.

Milk mostly comes from industrialised farming of cows and anyone who knows about industrialised farming would know that the living conditions of ""industrialised livestock"" is horrendous. Milk that comes from industrialised farming of cows is more likely than not contaminated with nasty stuff such as pus and excess antibiotics. Also, while most people can tolerate the lactose in milk and milk products such as cheese, milk is actually an optional food item at best. Think about it, early human societies that did not raise animal livestock lived fine without milk so we should be capable of doing the same. Don't get me wrong, I like cheese but eating a cheese tart made me suffer a gastric reflux after following the Wildfit program.

In conclusion, refined sugar, wheat products and dairy products are overrated food items and ingredients and we are actually better off avoiding them to stay healthy. Instead, take more vegetables, lean meat and water. Fruits and starchy root vegetables such as cassava are also fine but in moderation since they are rich in carbohydrates.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, my sister in law suggested to me and my mother to try out a diet/lifestyle program called Wildfit.

Last year, I went through a crisis and ate so much sugar I was disgusted with myself.

I've since permanently put myself on an extremely low-sugar diet for the rest of my life.

I was eating whole boxes of cookies and whole cakes on the weekends. I compensated by eating less carbs throughout the week and cutting out sugary or fatty dressings. And I switched to vegan ketchup(less than 1g sugar per tbsp) and organic mustard (55g sodium per  tbsp). Sometimes, I was eating a few cookies a day or a few over the course of the week.

As part of my detox, I have given up processed meat (lunch meat like baloney and such), ham, pork, hot dogs, bacon, sausage, salami, liverwurst.

Actually, I do ham, pork, sausage once a month. I'll eat all these in a month, but not more than once. I only eat ground turkey or ground beef or chicken (i get all these from my grocery store in town, from the butcher. i don't buy cheap packaged meat) or high quality canned meats like tuna or chicken (that have little or no fat in them). Not canned pork. I also try to eat organic bread that has lower sodium and 1g sugar per slice.

My daily meals consist of meat, peanut butter, oatmeal (less than gram sugar per half cup), or protein bars (never anything more than 10g total fat or 4g sat fat or more than 6 or 8 grams sugar). I cook everything. I don't drink soda or any juice drinks, actually haven't since I gave them up at 18. I only drink water, and use two packets of sugar free drink mix(these contain aspartame) a day. Sometimes, I use sugar free jelly with my peanut butter(it's made with splenda, by smuckers. 0.5g sugar per tbsp); no more than two tbsp a day. I have a whole cup of oatmeal every day(cause it's less sugary than eating vegetables and has a lot of fiber and my bread also has a lot of fiber. 5g per slice) and no more than two or three tbsp of peanut butter (it's a natural brand, 2g sugar and 16 total fat and 3 sat fat per serving).
I also cut out cheese to reduce fat intake so I can have peanut butter every day. Sometimes I cook my meat in fat, but I actually usually drain it all out as it cooks. I'm thinking about only having boiled eggs from now on to reduce fat intake.

I still have my sweets, but only once or twice on weekends and I try to keep my daily sugar intake below 16 on the weekdays. Some days, I can total 13 or 8 grams. I might eat 25 grams or more on the weekends, but I'm kinda trying to do no-fat sweets or just adding a ton of spices and sweety stuff to my oatmeal (go crazy that way). I don't use butter in my oatmeal to cut down on fat.

I stopped drinking regular milk and switched to unsweetened plant milk(has no sugar, is lower fat/carb) or protein flax milk (has more protein, same no-sugar and low carbs/fat).

Aside from the weekend sweets, I eat a whole pizza once a month (10 or 12 slices). But I'm contemplating (i actually did this this month) eating the pizza without the cheese and only eating the dough and meat/veggies/fruit. I basically stripped off the cheese from the slices, put the toppings back, and ate every piece with my vegan ketchup and seasonings (i got into using no/low sodium/salt/sugar seasons). Half of my pieces are vegetable/fruit and half are meat. I only meats on my pizza: chicken or beef or sausage or ham. No pepperoni.

Also, I don't eat fruit to cut back on sugar. Pizza day is the only day I get fruit in.

Some other details. I also stopped eating chips and ""snack"" foods when I was 18. Had some energy drinks in my teen years, but gave all those up around 18. Never done drugs of any kind. I am not the kind of person who has to ""salt"" his food. I only ever use pepper. My meat is usually plain unless it's something like a burger with ketchup and mustard, no cheese. Even with tacos and burritos, am considering giving up cheese. Don't even use sour cream with these, but still might use salsa.

I am worried for my heart, which is why I gave up cheese and a lot of fats. So I am trying to eat peanut butter and oatmeal everyday (for soluble fibers and unsaturated fats). The sweets I ate were pretty fatty. I was eating like this for a 4-7 month period before I started to dial it back and only eat sweets on weekends. 

I am also trying to eat eat avocados with my peanut butter (for the healthy fats).

Also, another thing to ask: All the binge'ing I did, can my body ""heal"" from all that or do just have to eat healthier from now on and *hope* ?

I have never actually binged on sweets in my life before. I mean, I ate that stuff as a kid but never like I did this year. The reason I get gave up soda was because I was drinking too much when I was 15 or so and my doc at the time said my blood pressure was high from it and I needed to stop and.. bad withdraws.

Also fast food; don't eat it more than 5 times a year, since I was 18. it's something else I gave up. probably not more than 3 times this year.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am 27 today.

&lt;p&gt;I was eating whole boxes of cookies and whole cakes on the weekends. I compensated by eating less carbs throughout the week and cutting out sugary or fatty dressings. And I switched to vegan ketchup(less than 1g sugar per tbsp) and organic mustard (55g sodium per  tbsp). Sometimes, I was eating a few cookies a day or a few over the course of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my detox, I have given up processed meat (lunch meat like baloney and such), ham, pork, hot dogs, bacon, sausage, salami, liverwurst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I do ham, pork, sausage once a month. I&amp;#39;ll eat all these in a month, but not more than once. I only eat ground turkey or ground beef or chicken (i get all these from my grocery store in town, from the butcher. i don&amp;#39;t buy cheap packaged meat) or high quality canned meats like tuna or chicken (that have little or no fat in them). Not canned pork. I also try to eat organic bread that has lower sodium and 1g sugar per slice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daily meals consist of meat, peanut butter, oatmeal (less than gram sugar per half cup), or protein bars (never anything more than 10g total fat or 4g sat fat or more than 6 or 8 grams sugar). I cook everything. I don&amp;#39;t drink soda or any juice drinks, actually haven&amp;#39;t since I gave them up at 18. I only drink water, and use two packets of sugar free drink mix(these contain aspartame) a day. Sometimes, I use sugar free jelly with my peanut butter(it&amp;#39;s made with splenda, by smuckers. 0.5g sugar per tbsp); no more than two tbsp a day. I have a whole cup of oatmeal every day(cause it&amp;#39;s less sugary than eating vegetables and has a lot of fiber and my bread also has a lot of fiber. 5g per slice) and no more than two or three tbsp of peanut butter (it&amp;#39;s a natural brand, 2g sugar and 16 total fat and 3 sat fat per serving).
I also cut out cheese to reduce fat intake so I can have peanut butter every day. Sometimes I cook my meat in fat, but I actually usually drain it all out as it cooks. I&amp;#39;m thinking about only having boiled eggs from now on to reduce fat intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have my sweets, but only once or twice on weekends and I try to keep my daily sugar intake below 16 on the weekdays. Some days, I can total 13 or 8 grams. I might eat 25 grams or more on the weekends, but I&amp;#39;m kinda trying to do no-fat sweets or just adding a ton of spices and sweety stuff to my oatmeal (go crazy that way). I don&amp;#39;t use butter in my oatmeal to cut down on fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped drinking regular milk and switched to unsweetened plant milk(has no sugar, is lower fat/carb) or protein flax milk (has more protein, same no-sugar and low carbs/fat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the weekend sweets, I eat a whole pizza once a month (10 or 12 slices). But I&amp;#39;m contemplating (i actually did this this month) eating the pizza without the cheese and only eating the dough and meat/veggies/fruit. I basically stripped off the cheese from the slices, put the toppings back, and ate every piece with my vegan ketchup and seasonings (i got into using no/low sodium/salt/sugar seasons). Half of my pieces are vegetable/fruit and half are meat. I only meats on my pizza: chicken or beef or sausage or ham. No pepperoni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I don&amp;#39;t eat fruit to cut back on sugar. Pizza day is the only day I get fruit in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other details. I also stopped eating chips and &amp;quot;snack&amp;quot; foods when I was 18. Had some energy drinks in my teen years, but gave all those up around 18. Never done drugs of any kind. I am not the kind of person who has to &amp;quot;salt&amp;quot; his food. I only ever use pepper. My meat is usually plain unless it&amp;#39;s something like a burger with ketchup and mustard, no cheese. Even with tacos and burritos, am considering giving up cheese. Don&amp;#39;t even use sour cream with these, but still might use salsa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am worried for my heart, which is why I gave up cheese and a lot of fats. So I am trying to eat peanut butter and oatmeal everyday (for soluble fibers and unsaturated fats). The sweets I ate were pretty fatty. I was eating like this for a 4-7 month period before I started to dial it back and only eat sweets on weekends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also trying to eat eat avocados with my peanut butter (for the healthy fats).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, another thing to ask: All the binge&amp;#39;ing I did, can my body &amp;quot;heal&amp;quot; from all that or do just have to eat healthier from now on and &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never actually binged on sweets in my life before. I mean, I ate that stuff as a kid but never like I did this year. The reason I get gave up soda was because I was drinking too much when I was 15 or so and my doc at the time said my blood pressure was high from it and I needed to stop and.. bad withdraws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also fast food; don&amp;#39;t eat it more than 5 times a year, since I was 18. it&amp;#39;s something else I gave up. probably not more than 3 times this year.&lt;/p&gt;

Strawberry diet is one of the detox diets. It has a positive effect on burdened organs. It takes just 3 days to get up to 4 kilograms. And what more? You’ll enjoy it. The first day is probably the hardest for you. You will only eat strawberries and drink plenty of water. The next day, you can add some extra food to the strawberries and prepare your body for the third day to return to normal eating.

You need to limit some &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/Ny9Ve_ty-aI""&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt;, and fluids, so certain minerals don’t buildup in your body. Also at the same time, you will have to make sure to get the right balance of protein, minerals, fat, vitamins, and cholesterol. If you having #early_stages_of_chronic_kidney_disease, then there may be no specific limits on what you eat. But as your disease gets worse, you actually know about this disease when it comes at advanced stages because according to the #kidney_treatment_in_Ayurveda #kidney_disease is a sort of silent disease. That is the reason why you have to be more careful about what you put into your body. Following are the things you should avoid eating –  1. Sodium – Cut down the amount of sodium from your &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/Ny9Ve_ty-aI""&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;. This mineral is found naturally in many foods, it is beneficial to maintain water balance in your body but also increase #blood_pressure, swelling in ankles, and shortness of breath, the causes of chronic kidney disease.   2. Limit calcium and phosphorus – A person with chronic kidney disease is suffering from a high level of phosphorus, and this can put you at risk of heart disease. It will be beneficial for you to avoid eating fish and dairy products.   3. Reduce potassium intake – Avocado, banana, potatoes, spinach, beans, citrus juices, and fish are the sources of potassium. High potassium diet can increase the risk of heart disease and kidney related problems.  4. Protein intake - Cutting back fruits that are high in protein and also avoid eating seafood.

Protein Sources

Meat: Beef, chicken, pork, lamb, etc.

Fish and Seafood: Salmon, trout, shrimp, etc.

Eggs: Whole eggs with the yolk are best.

The importance of eating plenty of protein cannot be overstated.

This has been shown to boost metabolism by 80 to 100 calories per day.

High-protein diets can also reduce cravings and obsessive thoughts about food by 60%, reduce the desire for late-night snacking by half, and make you so full that you automatically eat 441 fewer calories per day — just by adding protein to your diet.

&amp;#x200B;

1.Start small. Don’t start a major diet and run 5 miles every morning and do rock climbing every weekend. You’ll burn yourself out. You’ll feel stressed by the time commitment. Make a small goal, maybe even with a finish line date (like the couch to 5K challenge I did) and do it. After success with a small goal you can try something bigger. And you’ll feel more confident from completing this first challenge you set for yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2. Love what you eat. I’ve had a few people ask me what my “secret” is since you can pretty easily see I love cookies and cake and pie (not to mention cheese and pasta and beer!). I eat what I love, but in moderation. Dieting has never worked for me. I do a bad job of keeping track of calories or points or whatever the new thing is. If that works for you, then do it. But I haven’t had any success with diets. I eat what I love in moderation. I have one or two cookies, instead of four or five. I make an effort to find fruits and vegetables that I love and eat those a lot more. I don’t eat, unless I’m hungry. I listen to my body and its needs. For me, keeping it simple like this is best. But I won’t lie. It does require some self control. Which is learned skill. And if I can do it, so can you!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. Do something active that you enjoy. You don’t have to go running if you hate running. It’s ok. If joining a gym doesn’t fit in your budget, don’t be discouraged. There are so many fun (and free) ways to get active. You could clean your house. Take your dog on a hike. Ride your bike to the grocery store. Volunteer to help pack boxes for a food pantry. Whatever. Just try to get active for an hour a few times a week.

There are only 4 real rules to losing weight.  1) counting calories .. 2) eating to the caloric debt.  3) The B/L/D eating regimen is so far out of bounds as to how our metabolism works, it is criminal as to how it fucks up the diet plan and keeps people fat.. Lastly.. 4) GET THE FUCKING SUGAR OUT OF YOUR DIET.. processed sugar calories are what keeps you overweight. 

Why people will dance about the most direct way to losing weight drive me nuts.  

I put myself and my wife on a diet of calorie count. followed the SCIENCE. Removed direct sugar calories and began eating a simple breakfast and nibbled and ate (allways counting calories) and kept the ravenous need to eat at bay that puts you into ""starvation"" and slows your metabolism. 

Here is a fact .. Fat does not make you fat .. you can metabolize fat pretty well, it is sugar bypassing the liver that MAKES FAT. 

CDC.. do not expect to lose more than 2 pounds a week. A 3 year study found those who lose 1- 2 pounds a week at most are most likey to keep the weight off.. You cannot afford to have your metabolism slow down in a ""starvation"" mode

Does it work .. 65 pounds down on my side, 35 on my wife's .. No more bullshit diets. and my blood sugar is down to near normal and reversing my type 2. .. B/L/D eating will fucking kill you. you need to not only count calories but change the very foundation of how we eat for this to work.

The choice to eat and drink during [\#dialysis](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dialysis) can really impact the treatment process. Waste builds up inside the blood can make you sick when taking dialysis and hence it is important to watch out what you eat and drink during the entire session. This can be done by matching what to eat and drink with what kidneys can remove at that time. Excess toxins build up in the body may cause:  • Swelling in the body parts during dialysis • Changes in the blood pressure • Making it hard for you to breath  Hemodialysis removes fluids in time safely manner hence, if you consume too much fluid in your diet, the treatment may not completely eliminate the toxins and bring other complications in the body. Renal diet for the [\#dialysis\_patients](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dialysis_patients)  • Protein: If you are on hemodialysis and have treatment thrice a week, then you need to limit protein. But if you are taking [\#peritoneal\_dialysis](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23peritoneal_dialysis) then you will need to consume more protein. This is because PD is performed all day and night to keep waste out of your body. Lean meat, fish and white egg can be taken after consulting your doctor.  • Sodium and salt: Consume low-salt and sodium related food in your diet when on dialysis. Alternatively, you can take herbs and spices as a substitute for salt and sodium but make sure they are not high in potassium.   • Whole grains: Eat more whole grains in your renal diet as the carbohydrates make the blood sugar level high in the body. To diabetic patients, the doctor advises to take whole bread at least 6 to10times each day but brown bread and brown rice should be refrained from eating.  • Milk products: Dialysis patients should consume fewer milk products such as cheese and milk.  A diabetic patient can have these products but not when taking [\#hemodialysis](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hemodialysis). Also, avoid low-fat milk as this type of milk is rich in phosphorus which is not good for dialysis patients.   • High potassium fruits: Fruits are good when planning a renal diet but avoid foods that are rich in phosphorus such as kiwi, peach, banana and musk melon. Substitute them for apple, berries, cherries, grapes, and pineapple only after recommendation from the doctor.  • Liquid: Hard drinks such as alcohol, soda, and other high carbohydrate and sugary drinks should be avoided as they increase the blood sugar level in the body. Instead, fresh fruit juices are best to consume when on [\#dialysis](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dialysis).   • Vegetables: Every green vegetable contains potassium in some quantity, but dialysis patients can eat them after soaking-water that too in a limited amount.   Diet for dialysis patients plays an important part when taking dialysis by [\#kidney\_patients](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kidney_patients).

Also, avoid low-fat milk as this type of milk is rich in phosphorus which is not good for dialysis patients.   • High potassium fruits: Fruits are good when planning a renal diet but avoid foods that are rich in phosphorus such as kiwi, peach, banana and musk melon. Substitute them for apple, berries, cherries, grapes, and pineapple only after recommendation from the doctor.  • Liquid: Hard drinks such as alcohol, soda, and other high carbohydrate and sugary drinks should be avoided as they increase the blood sugar level in the body. Instead, fresh fruit juices are best to consume when on &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23dialysis""&gt;#dialysis&lt;/a&gt;.   • Vegetables: Every green vegetable contains potassium in some quantity, but dialysis patients can eat them after soaking-water that too in a limited amount.   Diet for dialysis patients plays an important part when taking dialysis by &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kidney_patients""&gt;#kidney_patients&lt;/a&gt;. Kidney patients can also take &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/hRT9iwtEVXo""&gt;#kidney_treatment_in_Ayurveda&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the condition of dialysis and &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23transplant""&gt;#transplant&lt;/a&gt; in their life.    &lt;/p&gt;

Survey is can be found here: [https://forms.gle/gH8fsT8uDva8EerSA](https://forms.gle/gH8fsT8uDva8EerSA)

We are a group of college students looking into understanding how food allergies can affect the grocery shopping process. We are trying to determine how common food allergies are and at what ages. The goal is to create an app that would enable users to enter their allergies (or dietary restrictions), enter the product they are looking for and then the app will generate a list of all said products that do not contain those allergens. The user will view a list of all grocery stores that sell the product near by.

If you have the time and you or someone in your family mainly does the grocery shopping for the household, please feel free to take the survey!

The hidden sugar in our diet is hard to find. You’ll be amazed at the things that have added and often unnecessary sugar inside. There are two things to look at, its not only the added sugar but the carbohydrates in the food. At the end of the day, carbs turn into sugar with the same effect on your blood sugar level:

1. Breakfast Cereal – Most of you could have guessed this one, but we’re not talking about the sugar in sugary cereal. We’re talking about hidden sugar in so-called healthy cereals. Some ""healthy"" cereals have more than 23 grams of sugar per serving.
2. Asian Food – Most restaurant-made or packaged Asian food has an enormous amount of sugar in it. Even sushi. The way you make sushi rice includes adding sugar to it. You can make your own Asian food to ensure that the sugar level is not too high.
3. Canned and Packaged Soups and Sauces – Thankfully, all you have to do is check the labels. Some yogurt has more than 15 grams of sugar! Even spaghetti sauce and gravy can have more sugar than a soda pop. If you want to be sure to eat less sugar, read labels and find no-sugar options or make your own.
4. Frozen Yogurt – Just because the word yogurt is in it doesn’t mean it’s healthy. It’s just as sugary as regular ice-cream. It’s a dessert. Treat it as if it’s a dessert. Don’t use it for a meal, and don’t believe you’re eating healthier. If you prefer real ice cream for a snack you are now free to eat it instead, as one is not better than the other when it comes to sugar.
5. Smoothies – They’re all the rage and there are many smoothie shops out there banking on it. But, most smoothie shops use fruit with added sugar which removes any benefits you would have from drinking a smoothie at all. If you make your own, watch it when recipes ask for dried fruit too. Using whole, fresh fruit is much better.
6. Bread – While there is some bread that is good for you, most bread is made with highly refined flour and sugar. Both of these affect blood sugar. Even wheat bread is high in sugar (Carbs), so you need to read the labels. Bread that is usually low in sugar is rye or spelt. Plus, you can make your own to avoid additives and sugar that can harm your health.
7. Condiments – You know we all like to dip everything. But, if you dip your fresh apples or celery into the wrong thing, you may be making matters worse. Instead, make your own condiments or read the labels. Today there are many low-sugar varieties of condiments, including low-sugar ketchup.
8. Canned Beans – Check the labels on canned beans, especially ones with any type of sauce on them like chili beans or baked beans. These are usually so high in sugar that if you compared it to a cake you wouldn’t know which was which just by the amount of sugar.
9. Muffins – You probably already realize that some muffins are high in sugar, but even the ones that sound healthy are just cakes in muffin form with a healthy flour or healthy name added. They are all high in sugar. There are some recipes for low-sugar muffins, though; just search the net and you’re sure to find them. You don’t have to do without, replacing regular flour with almond-flouer and sugar with xylit does the trick.
10. Yogurt – Just like frozen yogurt is high in sugar, so is most sweetened yogurt - including low-fat yogurt. The best way to combat this problem is to make your own yogurt or eat yogurt as a dessert. You can also buy plain yogurt and add your own fruit and stevia to create a low-sugar snack that is healthy due to the probiotics in yogurt.

Anything premade and packaged is in danger of having too much sugar. It’s best to read the labels and judge for yourself. Keep in mind that the average adult should not consume more than 90 grams, or 5 percent of their total calories, in added sugar daily. If you are on a low carb diet, the value is even less, around 50 grams a day, including carbs.

They are all high in sugar. There are some recipes for low-sugar muffins, though; just search the net and you’re sure to find them. You don’t have to do without, replacing regular flour with almond-flouer and sugar with xylit does the trick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yogurt – Just like frozen yogurt is high in sugar, so is most sweetened yogurt - including low-fat yogurt. The best way to combat this problem is to make your own yogurt or eat yogurt as a dessert. You can also buy plain yogurt and add your own fruit and stevia to create a low-sugar snack that is healthy due to the probiotics in yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything premade and packaged is in danger of having too much sugar. It’s best to read the labels and judge for yourself. Keep in mind that the average adult should not consume more than 90 grams, or 5 percent of their total calories, in added sugar daily. If you are on a low carb diet, the value is even less, around 50 grams a day, including carbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I’m looking at about 165 lbs (75 kg right now) and is like to get down to my OG weight while maintaining most of my strength and lean muscle. 

Right now I’m doing Bret Contreras’ Gluteal Goddess for Advanced Lifters program and supplementing with accessory lifts and cardio on days off. 

I’m ballparking around 1500-1700 for sustainable weight loss but I’m running out of ideas on what to eat. I can’t figure out a macro split that works well and is easy to maintain plus keeps my palate entertained. I get bored very easily so I cannot do same dish 5 days in a row (at one point I ate so much chicken due to meal prep I literally began gagging when I ate it.) My endocrinologist recommended AIP or Gluten Free but I can’t freaking do that. All the Gluten Free crap that isn’t keto makes me sluggish and is high in carbs. I tried doing keto before but my strength plummeted and I was never in true keto because I didn’t want to cut my protein (still wanted to maintain lean muscle mass.) So no keto please. 

Can someone please halp?

New research has found that establishing healthy dietary patterns might be beneficial in preventing the development of dementia. In the study, researchers focused on over 2,600 participants, aged 25-45, who took part in a Mediterranean-style diet. Participants were administered questionnaires over 3-time points to assess their average dietary intake. The findings were published in the journal *Neurology*.

I am currently 27 years old. I currently weight 119 kg (262 lb) and 1.77m (5.7ft) . 1 month and a week ago i was 134 kg (295 lb) which is obese. So I started cutting my calories and only ate fruits and veggies. i had like an apple for breakfast , tuna salad for lunch and fruits like grapes or 2 oranges for dinner (5 pm) never ate past 6 pm. 

So fast forward I lost 30 lb, after the first three weeks, i feel like my weight almost stopped dropping , only 1 lb per 3-4 days. So I went to google the problem and found out that my body metabolism might have slowed down because of the lack of Leptin from carbs and the solution is to have a cheat meal once a week.


Is it true that a cheat meal is a must to boost the leptin rise again? Or is it untrue? If anyone could help enlighten the situation I would be pretty thankful.

edit: If a cheat meal is a must does a 300g(rice) curry rice with carrots , kimchi, and a boiled shrimp good for the meal? Or do i need to cut the rice to 200g?

Hi everybody! I’m a 24 years old girl and I need some help. Last week I started a low calories diet, without any kind of sugar and low carbs level. But I feel veeeery low and tired and depressed.  
 In the past I’ve suffered from bulimia, I used to eat too much -expecially sugar and junk food- and that’s why my weight increased in a very short time (even if I’ve tried to throw up everything). Now I’m trying to heal myself and my body, and I want to see the food like my friend, I’m trying to kick out all the toxins from my body and I wanna be a good-looking person. 

I go to university - I pass the most of the time sitting for studying and during the exams period I’m really anxious and I vent on food – Now I wanna lose fat, so I’m working out (with a lightly level) and that’s why I need a low calories diet, but my mind is down and I need something to cheer me up. Can you help me?

Maybe the bug is in the diet?

It’s based on: Oat milk and spelt flakes for breakfast, beans and whole grains cereals for lunch, animals proteins (eggs, fish, meat) with soluble fibers (vegetables) for dinner. Away from the main meal I eat some fruits. 

I workout every day (love when endorphins pervade the brain). 

Hope someone can give me a suggestion.

Thanks for reading and I’m sorry for my bad english.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody! I’m a 24 years old girl and I need some help.

It’s unfortunate though that my body seems to reject it. Anyway this is a long one! Sorry.

A year and a half ago, I first tried keto. I really cut down on carbs and sugar, and did my own salad and cooked my meats. I did lose weight, however I felt sick after weeks on the diet. I thought it was maybe allergies, but when I went to the ENT she diagnosed me with Laryngopharangeal reflux or LRP. It turned out it was my acid reflux that’s triggering my allergies and rhinitis. She put me on PPIs and allergy meds for a couple of weeks, after which I felt so much better. I also quit the keto diet.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, I went back on the Keto diet because I wanted to lose weight faster (I know, not a good mindset) for a wedding I’m attending this week. I was strictly on very low or almost no sugar, and high fat diet and veggies. Last Wednesday night, I experienced some stomach cramps and I couldn’t go to sleep. I must have slept for like 3 hours, and had to go to a meeting. I didn’t really have a proper meal the whole day and just had a small sausage and small portion of eggs. I just knew something was not right so I went to the ER to get my stomach cramps checked, and I was so surprised that it wasn’t even the problem. My blood pressure shot up to 170/100. It was the first time this happened to me! My blood pressure is usually 120/80 or 110/70. I just couldn’t believe it. I stayed at the hospital for about 4 hours because my doctor won’t allow me to leave until it drops to normal. Eventually it got to 140/80 which is still a bit high for my standards. He put me on Amlodipine for a few weeks and asked to monitor my BP if it shoots up again. He also advised me to consult a dietician if it’s the right diet for me. 

I decided to quit the Keto diet after that. I was so scared. It’s the first time it happened to me and I don’t want to be on any maintenance meds. I’m hoping I won’t have to and so far my BP has dropped to 120/70 or 110/70 again.

To be fair, I’m not certain it’s the Keto diet that caused my BP to shoot up as I had lack of sleep, no food, and stressed that day. But I feel better now and I really don’t think it’s worth it to risk experiencing it again. So far I’ve been eating a balanced diet and going for runs. It’s not even about losing weight for me now but being healthy. But of course I’d want to get fit too :)

Sadly, many people miss out on one or more of these and it greatly costs them their success.

Want to learn more? Check out the list of five commandments below.

**Thou Shall Eat More Protein**

Of all the foods that you could eat while on a fat loss diet, protein is perhaps the most important. Protein helps combat hunger, it helps stabilize blood glucose levels, and it helps prevent lean muscle mass loss. This in turn helps speed up your metabolism and accelerates the process of fat loss.

Don’t let your diet intake fall short. Aim to eat some protein in each and every meal and snack that you consume.

**Thou Shall Eat Regularly**

While the concept that your metabolism will increase the more often you eat isn’t entirely accurate — as the boost you get after a meal is directly related to the size of that meal — eating regularly does help to keep hunger at bay.

By feeding your body frequently throughout the day, you’ll help avoid food cravings and energy lows, making it that much easier to stick to your diet program.

**Thou Shall Prioritize Fresh Foods**

When selecting your foods, eating fresh is a must. We live in a world where processed foods are around every corner and just waiting to cause us weight gain.

Eliminate these and you’ll really give your diet a boost. Focus on foods in their natural state — fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and oils, and lean proteins.

If you only make one change to your diet plan, make it this one.

**Thou Shall Set Short-Term Goals**

One diet rule that you should abide by and follow is to always set short-term goals for yourself. Think about what you are doing in the here and now, not months from now. It’s too easy to lose sight of your goals if they are going to take place six months to a year down the road.

Try thinking in three-week segments. Three weeks is about how long it takes for good habits to form, so it is the perfect amount of time to build behaviors that will stand the test of time.

This is precisely why The 3 Week Diet was created. It will help you stay motivated and consistent until you don’t even have to think about making those changes any longer. They’ll just be automatic.

**Thou Shall Stop Comparisons**

Finally, stop comparing yourself to others. Realize that this is your own journey and your own body. It’s unlike anyone else’s so you simply can’t expect to see the same results as everyone else.

Instead, start comparing yourself today to yourself from yesterday. That will give you all the details you need to know. If each day you are getting better, you are successful in your journey.

So keep these diet commandments in mind. Focus on these and you can feel confident that you are headed in the right direction.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To really see best results from any diet plan you choose to use, you need to learn a few “diet commandments.” These are guidelines that must be followed if you are going to see superior results that will help propel you forward.&lt;/p&gt;

After all, I had been going to the gym since 2015, while more or less following the **Slow**\-**Carb Diet** throughout the period.

Yes, at first everything seemed to work. I was following the workout regime from **The 4-Hour Body** by **Tim Ferriss**, meanwhile only eating lean meat, beans and veggies. No white foods like sugar, pasta, rice, bread or cheese on most days. And the weight + strength seemed to be increasing.

But over time, the process seemed to slow down and basically stop. I was still going to the gym and eating well. Even tried to change the exercise regime a bit. Yet, this did not seem to be enough. And when the results stop coming then the motivation starts to fade as well.

His answer was somewhat surprising, as I did not think he would be one to care about the food going in. Especially as his breakfast tends to be a bar of chocolate and some shady energy drink — no supplements, tho. But there he was, recommending me to start **counting calories**, *which he apparently also did.*

So on January 2nd, I downloaded **MyFitnessPal**, an app that asks you to enter all the foods you eat through the day. Either scan the packages or search for them individually — even most Estonian brands can be found from there. And now I have been using it for the last 2.5 months.

The app itself is great as it lets you choose the desired result and calculates the needed daily calorie intake, dividing it between carbs, fats and proteins. If you were to pay for it, then it even suggests the meals to eat. However, that is not necessary.

My first discovery after using it for a week was that I did not fulfil even the bare minimum of daily suggested protein intake. Not just the minimum to grow muscle but the minimum to even function as a healthy person.

Apparently, people should consume 1 gram of protein per 1 kilogram of their weight, daily. Meanwhile, to grow muscle, this should be increased to 2–2.5 grams per kilogram. However, I was constantly getting only 0.85–0.9 grams per kilogram, even though I thought I was eating enough. No wonder that the results were not increasing.

Looking into it, the research shows that most people have the same problem. We talk about eating too many carbs and fat. But the big issue is that we do not eat enough protein!

Anyway, after fixing this, I started to see an increase in the size of weights I can lift, as well as how fast I recover. Basically, I have almost doubled the weights since, while my Oura ring says that I sleep much better.

So what have I changed in eating since? Not much else but the quantity of meat and other food. In fact, most of my protein intake comes from eating chicken, cottage cheese, curd cream, kidney beans and an occasional protein shake. I also try to eat more eggs but have not done too much of that, so far.

However, I have realised that eating out is a no-no. Not because it would be hard to count the calories there but because the amount of protein per meal is not sufficient. And if anything then Subway seems to be one of the best places to get the protein from — but it also comes with so many carbs that it does not make sense.

As a bonus, I also realised that I did not get much of anything out of breakfast. I could, of course, eat 3–4 eggs and get a lot of protein. But until now, I have not been a big breakfast eater. So after hearing a bunch about the **intermittent fasting** where one only eats during an 8-hour window, I decided to test it out. Let’s see whether it helps anything…

I was 25 yrs old, 5”11 and 167 lbs when I began last year, and it became a whole new obsession... gone wrong. At first I just ate small healthy meals, with some animal products and frequent exercise. Even though I indulged in binger snacks sometimes, I lost 25-30 lbs from that alone within months, however, I was never happy with how skinny I was even at a mere 140 lb’s. I wanted to be even thinner. So...

Within the past weeks I began researching different diets. I decided the CRON diet (calorie restriction and optimal nutrition) was best for me, and began to eat 100% animal product free (mistakenly assuming I needed to).

The worst part... I only ate 1500-1600 calories a day for weeks. I quickly dropped 5 lbs in the first week, which was fast, but I loved the way I looked, at first. I quickly started losing even more weight. Little did I know I was actually 130 lbs at the end of it all (underweight) and mistaking my water weight for an actual 135 lbs every time I stepped on the scale. But I continued to eat only 1600 calories “just in case” and out of fear of being “fat again”.

It wasn’t until I began wasting away that I realized I was undereating. But my stomach never told me. By this time, my hunger signals weakened to the extent that I didn’t know when I was hungry anymore. I was in starvation mode every day. And not just that, I wasn’t getting any iron from meats or fish either.

Here is what I looked like! (Beware- scary skinny. February 2019)
https://ibb.co/8g18BRC

I am not mentally ill or anorexic and I will never eat less than I need to feel healthy. I have since increased my calorie intake to around 1900 and my weight is back to fluctuating around 135-140 lb’s.

Beware! You may be starving yourself and not even know it. Avoid extreme calorie restriction even if the food is nutritious. Veganism is a slippery slope to a multitude of health problems.
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I decided to start dieting and exercising again. I was 25 yrs old, 5”11 and 167 lbs when I began last year, and it became a whole new obsession... gone wrong. At first I just ate small healthy meals, with some animal products and frequent exercise. Even though I indulged in binger snacks sometimes, I lost 25-30 lbs from that alone within months, however, I was never happy with how skinny I was even at a mere 140 lb’s. I wanted to be even thinner. So...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the past weeks I began researching different diets. I decided the CRON diet (calorie restriction and optimal nutrition) was best for me, and began to eat 100% animal product free (mistakenly assuming I needed to).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part... I only ate 1500-1600 calories a day for weeks. I quickly dropped 5 lbs in the first week, which was fast, but I loved the way I looked, at first.

I would blame people for bringing snacks around. I would blame the weather for why I couldn't exercise. I would let someone making fun of me ""force me"" to over eat.

My emotional and diet life was determined by my outside circumstances.

I have come to realize, however, that this can be fixed by changing your paradigm and accepting that you are RESPONSIBLE for what happens in your life.  You can decide to let outside factors affect your decisions and eating habits, but that does not have to be the case.

&amp;#x200B;

Research shows that the language we use, affects the way that we think, which in turn affects what we do.

I don&amp;#39;t do it on purpose, it just really happens, out of laziness mostly.... the problem is the more I do it the more I get full quickly. Which means I am gonna eat less and less... I need to stop this situation but I don&amp;#39;t know how to. &lt;/p&gt;

So I set my diet to just be 1500 calories and out of the last two weeks I have only hit that number 3 times on days I didn't go to the gym.

What I eat (day 1-11) (Calorie count is according to Myplate app)

Break fast  (304 calories)

\- Two eggs and 3 pieces of bacon

Lunch and Dinner (381 each meal)

\- Braised Chicken thigh

\- Half a cup of green beans

\- Three cherry tomatoes

Gym Routine:

\- Usually I do the elliptical for 20 mins + the 5 min cool down thing it tells me to do, so its about 2 miles and i burn like 350-400 calories depending on the day. My goal is usually to burn a meal from the elliptical alone

\- Then I do Shoulder press machine for 10 reps then 7, 5,3, and then repeat.

\- Next I do some other arm and shoulder machines (same amount of reps as shoulder press) that I honestly dont know what there called but I do em like the monkey i am LOL.

TLDR: I have been dieting and working out for 2 weeks, minimal carbs (33 avg) Wondering about my calorie intake since I usually aim for like 1300 from just eating and then I burn at least 300 of it from running the elliptical alone. I go to uni, so besides the work out i posted above I dont do much really. Just wondering about my calorie intake.

(Edit: Def not going to be eating rice, I should of did some research on it before posting, sorry. )","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys my first post here so just have a few questions. I am a heavy guy (300+, 5&amp;#39;11) so I looked up my base metabolic and I got a range of 2500 to 3500, so I am going with 2500 BMR.  So I set my diet to just be 1500 calories and out of the last two weeks I have only hit that number 3 times on days I didn&amp;#39;t go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I eat (day 1-11) (Calorie count is according to Myplate app)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break fast  (304 calories)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Two eggs and 3 pieces of bacon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lunch and Dinner (381 each meal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Braised Chicken thigh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Half a cup of green beans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Three cherry tomatoes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gym Routine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Usually I do the elliptical for 20 mins + the 5 min cool down thing it tells me to do, so its about 2 miles and i burn like 350-400 calories depending on the day. My goal is usually to burn a meal from the elliptical alone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Then I do Shoulder press machine for 10 reps then 7, 5,3, and then repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Next I do some other arm and shoulder machines (same amount of reps as shoulder press) that I honestly dont know what there called but I do em like the monkey i am LOL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my post.&lt;/p&gt;

The Beck Diet Solution is an approach to dieting based on cognitive behaviours. You read one small chapter each day, and add new practices to reinforce the helpful behaviours.

I did most of the book last year, and found it very helpful. Like many other times, life got busy and I let the good habits I learned slide. I’d like to start back at day 1, and would love to have a few people to do it with to keep each other accountable.

The book is available on Amazon electronically for about $10. I’m sure it’s also available at many other book stores.

Anyone care to join me?

This is my first post here, so forgive me for any procedural errors.

I am a 24-years old, male, between 5""10 and 5""11.  I've always been heavier/huskier but I really began to put on weight during college and, now, law school.  I am in the mid-240s.  I have no business being this weight, and in the LONG term I hope to get down to about 180, and then see where to go from there.  

Anyways, my friend who was once very heavy is now quite slim, and he told me it all comes down to counting calories, so I have been doing that.  I am really limiting myself to under 1600 calories a day for a theoretical 2 lbs/week loss.  If I find I cannot stick with this, I will up my calories a bit so I do not ""burn out."" I have been also eating better foods (raw and grilled mixed vegetables, raw spinach, artichoke hearts, hard-boiled eggs, and grilled meat (usually chicken, occasionally beef)).  I have also begun to hit the gym three times a week (going HARD on an elliptical for 35 min, going just around 4 miles in that time). I also snack on bananas or 90-calorie granola bars throughout the day. I drink mostly water, coffee when I need it (splash of cream), and sometimes milk. Never soda, etc.

Now for my question: In spite of consuming fewer calories, working out, etc., I find that I am actually LESS hungry than I was before I began these lifestyle changes.  I am not craving food, and am satisfied during the day without even coming close to my 1600 calorie limit! (I'll eat about 1000 in a day and feel just fine). What's going on??

I have a long history of eating disorders. Most recently I had started eating around 900 calories per day and got down to about 105 lbs.

I'm 6'5, 300 lbs, and I hate my body. My doctor told me to work out and cut back. Here's the issue.

I hate exercising. I don't live a sedimentary lifestyle, but I hate the gym. Can't stand it. I don't know how I'm supposed to teach myself to love it so I've given up on that. All I do is jog every day and I do sports sometimes.
So what I'm trying is diet. But my family lives well below the poverty line (living paycheck to paycheck) and I can't control what I eat. We usually eat fast food or slammed-together meals, which aren't very good for you.
Naturally, I'm a fat-ass. I can't stand it. I feel extremely guilty whenever I eat, no matter what. But that guilt isn't enough to stop me from eating junk and drinking soda.

What is the best way to determine what the best type of diet is for my blood type, DNA, etc?

I’ve always had a problem being skinny fat. I’ve tried all types of diets, making sure to eat healthy and including high protein but I’ve had no luck. I’ve also went vegan and have been vegan the last 2 years and I’m still skinny fat. Mind you I get blood tests multiple times a year and make sure my b12 and iron levels are perfect. My blood work is basically perfect, its just my physique that’s the problem lol

With that being said, what is the best way to approach this so I can alter my diet correctly? Who do I go to to get tested so I can determine what foods work best for my body type, blood, DNA, etc.

I was put on a medication called Zyprexa a few months back and it made me gain twenty pounds. Since then I've stopped it, but now I'm 5'7"" and 150 pounds. I've been off of it for a month and a half. I've been dieting and exercising like a madwoman, but I've only lost about two pounds.

Background: former D1 athlete used to eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.  Transitioned into a desk job and have basically gained 40lbs of fat, though maintained a decent level of fitness so have kept some of the muscle I put on during my collegiate career (27y/o 5'11'' @ ~250)


Exercise plan: Orange theory 3-5x per week (700-850 kcal per workout according to apple watch) and potentially 1-2 swim workouts (~500 kcal per workout according to apple watch) - idea being something where I get my heart rate up almost every day.


Diet Plan: Just did a TDEE on an online calculator and it said 3300 based on my current workout routine from above, a day.  That seems ridiculously high to me.  My aim is to eat a 2000 calorie diet having &lt;100g of carbs, between 150g-200g protein, and the remainder being fat ~90g assuming the high end of protein spectrum.


Allow myself to indulge on occasion but on a daily basis no sugar, no beer, and no starchy carbs (mostly bread pasta etc.).  Wine and spirits okay on weekends but not to excess as I make terrible dieting decisions when inebriated...



Calculation:

3300 kCal - 2000 kCal = 1300 kCal deficit per day

1300 * 7 = 9100 kCal deficit per week

9100/3600 = ~2.5lbs per week



About 16 weeks to get back to a relatively healthy weight and  reevaluate from there.


Does that seem right to you weight loss gurus out there? Do you think I will be eating too much or too little?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello - looking for some guidance on my weight loss plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background: former D1 athlete used to eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted.  Transitioned into a desk job and have basically gained 40lbs of fat, though maintained a decent level of fitness so have kept some of the muscle I put on during my collegiate career (27y/o 5&amp;#39;11&amp;#39;&amp;#39; @ ~250)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise plan: Orange theory 3-5x per week (700-850 kcal per workout according to apple watch) and potentially 1-2 swim workouts (~500 kcal per workout according to apple watch) - idea being something where I get my heart rate up almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;

I've never been in this position before. 

I used to be super active, in mega high stress job, and I had intestinal parasites, all of which kept me underweight, and unable to gain any. (I didn't know about the parasites, I thought it was just genetics. I have no idea how I got them, or how long I had them, but I bet I had them most of my  life, given how much my metabolism changed since I got rid of them 4 years ago.)

Then 2 years ago, I traded that shitty job for a totally sedentary one- and it gets worse. 

I didn't know I should change my eating habits. I used to be ravenously hungry all the time, so I ate what/when ever I felt like it.  Life was fun! And that was how I was used to living. I thought I could still eat whatever/ whenever. Nope.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing fits me anymore. I am double the pants size I've been my entire teen/ adult life, which freaks me out. And, I'm 10 pounds overweight, according to how I look &amp; feel &amp; according to height/ weight charts. (Well... actually they say I'm 2 pounds overweight, but losing 10 will put me right in the middle of healthy weight for my height, so that's what I want. I feel like I look fat.)

&amp;#x200B;

So. Is losing 10 pounds and never gaining it back a real phenomenon? I've heard people say it's incredibly hard to lose 10 pounds. Is it? I don't care how long it takes; obviously it took me 4 years to gain 30 pounds, so I know weight changes aren't a fast thing, and I don't mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

How hard is it to keep it off ?I 've never known anyone who went on a diet, lost weight, then stayed that goal weight the rest of their lives, do you know anyone that has? Are there any real 'diet success stories'? 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I actually go on a ""diet"", or start counting calories, or will just eating healthy from now on be good enough?

&amp;#x200B;

My apt complex has a weight room I feel like I should get that place figured out &amp; start using it. Should I set some kind of goal, like so many minutes, or so many times a week?

&amp;#x200B;

If you can help me, please post. If you are in the mood to be mean, please don't post. Maybe get off the internet &amp; go volunteer somewhere for a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

If you sell some kind of diet drugs or drinks, or especially if you are involved in any MLM thing, I am totally not interested, but good luck, I hope it works for you.

Some serious things have come up in my life to the point where I need to lose weight. I’m not morbidly obese or anything. You’ll see why in just a sec though.

My father was diagnosed when he was 14 and we believe this was a big factor in him passing a few years ago at 40. So I have a very high chance of getting diabetes. This scares me just because the simple fact of my father passing so soon. I really would like some help on what to do. I work 3rd shift a local factory so time is kinda a hard thing to come by cause I also go to college but I have set up a workout plan I’m going to start either next week or the week after. I work 10pm-6:30 am. No matter how tired I am at work as soon as I leave I’m wide awake. So I figure this would be the perfect time to just go to the gym. So here’s the schedule 
Sunday-any time I want. 
Monday- after work
Tuesday- day off
Wednesday- after work 
Thursday - after work. 
Friday-after work 
Saturday-day off
Basically though I really need help with eating. No one in my household eats right and My family is moving to Tennessee within the next few months and I have significant other here and we’ve been together for years but I actually love it here so I’m staying.

I am trying to start eating better to lose weight, but have several things that make it difficult for me to eat healthy and have options. I am looking for advice and ideas on options. 

The following are things that often make it difficult for me:

1. I cannot cook. I have little to no skill with cooking. I can use an oven, microwave, or skillet. That’s about it. 

2. I don’t know recipes/options. I have tried walking around grocery stores to look for ideas, but I’m not that well versed in what to look for. 

3. I’m dependent upon variety. I get off track/bored very easily with food if I eat the same thing too often. 

4. I have a snacking issue. I find myself eating at random all of the time. When I’m bored, having a bad day, tryin to focus while I work, etc. I am already working on cutting down on how often I snack, but I need helping finding healthy snacks that are worth it. 

5. I don’t have a lot of time during the week to devote to meal prep. A LOT of my job comes home with me each day, and so meal prepping multiple times during the week can be hard. I have tried the whole meal prep for the whole week on Sunday, but by the time I get to the 4th day of food it always taste not-so-great (dry, stale, etc.). 


There are, however, some things that play into my favor: 

1. I am NOT picky when it comes to food. 

2. It is easy to not eat out at my job due to the nature of it/the daily schedule doesn’t allow for it, so I take my lunch every day. I have a mini fridge, microwave, and toaster at my disposal at work.

&lt;p&gt;Question: did I just throw away all my hard work fasting? That would suck. In the experience of any other fasters, are 6 days enough to achieve a reset in the digestive system?&lt;/p&gt;

\- sufficient, but limited protein (twice 30gr daily )

I've clearly started to not eat anything my parents cook because it's never appropriate for my liking's.

  I'm not technically a meat person but, I usually stick to boneless or artificial meat that goes in named brand packaging. I can never surely eat it any how other than that.

I know a lot about working out, but the part of staying in shape I struggle with most is my diet. It seems that every time my life starts to get even a little busy, I start to eat whatever I have time for, which is usually fast food. And if I ever happen to get a break in my busy schedule, my family's habit is to go out to a nice restaurant, where of course, I binge. Lastly, I even have a tendency to visit the vending machine and eat snack while I work.

How can I get myself on a healthy, ""grab-and-go"" diet plan? I've tried meal prep before, but unfortunately my area requires me to drive and pick them up, which takes a lot of time. They are also expensive and tend to taste badly after sitting in the fridge for a few days. Is there something else I can do that takes little time and effort(and preferably but not necessarily, money) to prepare?

I have not been eating my feelings, much less have I been eating that much, to begin with. I am overweight by a good 120+# for my height and I want to shed as much as possible and sustainable for my age range. (Early 30s)

I am basically already fasting, as I do not eat much else throughout the day besides my morning coffee and a bunch of water, though I eat dinner with my husband every night when he gets in from work. I am a lurker on the r/intermittentfasting page, though I have yet to find someone doing the Warrior diet. (I will be posting this there too in case those people are lurkers as well.)

I like the concept of the warrior diet, as it still allows for light snacking throughout the day if needed, most days I don't. For those that don't know, its 20 hours of underfeeding and 4 hours of overfeeding. So for 20 hours a day, I can enjoy my one cup of coffee I have a day, water, and snack on things like nuts, fruit, and pure popcorn. During the overfeeding hours, I eat a normal meal with my husband. (Admittedly, I don't understand why its called overfeeding unless they are comparing it to the rest of the day, because you need to eat better but reduce calories as well.)

My questions are:

1. Has anyone done this successfully?
2. What do you eat during the underfeeding hours?
3. Any recommendations for someone just starting out? 

I am also working out at home. I have dumbells and a kettlebell. I do beginners yoga to help with flexibility and some muscle toning. I do not take supplements and I do not use any sort of whey product or workout related product. I have found I have a lot more energy since I have started working out as well, which is really nice as it propels me to do my workouts earlier during my underfeeding time. 

Thanks to anyone who can help.  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am on antidepressants that with my recent-ish dose increase has made my hunger level and desire for food to go down. I have not been eating my feelings, much less have I been eating that much, to begin with. I am overweight by a good 120+# for my height and I want to shed as much as possible and sustainable for my age range. (Early 30s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am basically already fasting, as I do not eat much else throughout the day besides my morning coffee and a bunch of water, though I eat dinner with my husband every night when he gets in from work. I am a lurker on the &lt;a href=""/r/intermittentfasting""&gt;r/intermittentfasting&lt;/a&gt; page, though I have yet to find someone doing the Warrior diet. (I will be posting this there too in case those people are lurkers as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the concept of the warrior diet, as it still allows for light snacking throughout the day if needed, most days I don&amp;#39;t. For those that don&amp;#39;t know, its 20 hours of underfeeding and 4 hours of overfeeding. So for 20 hours a day, I can enjoy my one cup of coffee I have a day, water, and snack on things like nuts, fruit, and pure popcorn. During the overfeeding hours, I eat a normal meal with my husband. (Admittedly, I don&amp;#39;t understand why its called overfeeding unless they are comparing it to the rest of the day, because you need to eat better but reduce calories as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has anyone done this successfully?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you eat during the underfeeding hours?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any recommendations for someone just starting out? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also working out at home. I have dumbells and a kettlebell. I do beginners yoga to help with flexibility and some muscle toning. I do not take supplements and I do not use any sort of whey product or workout related product. I have found I have a lot more energy since I have started working out as well, which is really nice as it propels me to do my workouts earlier during my underfeeding time. &lt;/p&gt;

I (M 49) have familial hypercholesterolemia and am currently (for 8 months) being treated with PCSK9 inhibitor to delay the need for a bypass. The PCI surgeon would have wanted to block and stent 3 minor arteries when I was at the table following a heart attack nearly two years ago, but only one could be accessed due to tight bends or something. Statins nearly crippled me and caused me to gain weight last year, so was stopped one year ago. Luckily I lost 20-ish punds this summer for reasons not entirely understood, finally felt the effect of the PCI treatment and felt better than ever. I even ran several times a week, went on a mountain and hiked a lot of difficult terrain. If you had told me this in April I would never have believed you. I believe it to be a combination of the new meds (alirocumab), diet change (removed all flour, sugar and most known high-GI items) and perhaps an extraordinarily hot summer. LDL-cholesterol values are also looking A LOT better.

A typical day's diet now starts with oatmeal from 40-45g (1/2 cup) of oats, supplements of chrome, lecithin and a spoon of cod liver oil. 110g (1.5 oz) tin of mackerel in tomato for lunch. I try to have fish (salmon, trout, cod) with some kind of salad for dinner when I can, and try to avoid high GI items like pasta. I will however eat the meat/meatballs/whatever with broccoli, carrots or other roots when that is on the menu but I have to skip pancakes, lasagna and pizza. Also no cake. I can even go a friday night without my 2-3 cans of beer if I feel like not wanting to mess with my glucose levels that day. (I had almost eaten myself to diabetes 2 and would fall asleep from certain kinds of food - not to worry, my long-time and fasting glucose levels ar checked together with cholesterol levels every 3 months now) However my go-to has become cheese. A few slices of cheese with a spread of salted cod roe on (don't ask) won't hurt, right? But it amounts to a bit too much cheese and salted roe during the week. I want to curb this habit, but have no idea how.

As I have mentioned on top; I would be delighted to hear about your go-to's just to stagger off that slight hunger until lunchtime, as I spend much time at home due to inability to work from various reasons, and tend to visit the fridge more frequently than I should. Basically, I can eat all day...

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ´ve been with this regime the last 3 weeks, kind of been mixing different ideas, mostly IF (8;16), counting calories, IIFYM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Male, 35 years, 180cm or 5.9 feet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Start: 100Kg or 220pounds. After 3 weeks, 98kg or 216pounds &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- My macros with this plan, around 45-65% carbs, 10-15% fats, 40-50% protein &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Equipment: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- - Fitbit Ionic to count steps, cals, distance for my runs and watch my heartbeat and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- - Fitbit Aria, I weight myself everyday in the morning, after using the bathroom and before my first meal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- - I use &lt;a href=""https://trendweight.com""&gt;trendweight.com&lt;/a&gt; - Try to not get crazy with the day, just keep the eye with the trend. &lt;a href=""https://trendweight.com/u/711b1bb494564f/chart/4w.png""&gt;https://trendweight.com/u/711b1bb494564f/chart/4w.png&lt;/a&gt; this is my last 4 weeks chart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Workout days, I add more rice and baby carrots to cover around 1200 cals to fuel those Workouts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- IF 8:16, eating from 7am to 3PM, Tracking it with VORA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Aprox 24oz of water everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Try to workout at least 3 days each week, mostly indoor cycling, running, and lifting some weights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morning - 7AM: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 gr frozen blueberries + 16 oz lactose free milk + 1 protein scoop + Multivitamin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Option 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 gr frozen blueberries + 16 oz Orange Juice + 1 protein scoop + Multivitamin&lt;/p&gt;

As a health&amp;fitness blog writer, I started trying to advertise some of my first pieces on some facebook groups because I thought everyone would read them and aw my gawd how lucky I'd be.

I joined a few of the most human-filled ones, and started checking what the people were talking about while also gloriously spamming them, and I honestly couldn't believe my eyes.

People were drinking and/or consuming **countless ""shortcut"" products** that were supposed to help them lose weight while intoxicating their bodies in the most idiotic and harmful ways. The one thing they wouldn't do was g**et out of bed, eat a salad, and maybe take a walk for 20 minutes a day.**

They would prefer some sort of *magically poisonous tea* that was supposed to help them lose weight while doing nothing instead of actually altering some of the bad habits they built up over the years in order to lose weight.

One of those products was guava leaves tea. I never tried it, but the stories these people were telling - **how they feel awful, are sweating the entire day, are vomiting and have diarrhea, but they're losing pounds so that's ok,** touched me to the core.

I decided to research this topic of weight loss pills through (I'm not affiliated with them in any way)[ examine.com](https://examine.com/) \- if you haven't heard about this website, it's one of the most amazing websites I've had the honor to come across for anyone who takes supplements of any kind.

These guys compiled countless of studies into simple conclusions regarding one supplement or another - the ones that work and do a certain thing, and the ones that don't.

I decided to curate this website for the weight loss pills that actually worked and could help with weight loss while they're still healthy and worthy of consumption, and I realized one thing - most of the supplements that promise quick weight loss will harm your body in one way or another.

**Supplements are supplements and should be seen as such - an extra mile for every 10 miles worth of dieting and (hopefully) exercise. A bonus that's aligned with the other efforts you're making towards weight loss, not the way towards it.**

I found 35 weight loss pills studies have shown that are actually linked to weight loss using examine. **There may be more than these, and what I'm writing isn't future-proof at all given the constantly-changing nature of science.** But the evidence so far shows that these actually help in losing an extra pound or two per month while also keeping your body **clean and bulletproof.**

I won't go in-depth on each and every one of them, I'll just give the rate of increase in weight loss for those of which I could find it and a few words about them.

Here they are:

* **Resveratrol:** 3.2 extra pounds lost per month. Powerful anti-oxidant that shreds fat through an increase in thermogenesis.
* **Capsaicin:** The torturing element of hot peppers shows an 8% increase in weight loss, and it also works through thermogenesis. Best when taken 1 hour before exercise.
* **Evodia Fruit:** Effects are similar to Capsaicin, but it also reduces fat cell formation. The increase in weight loss rate is unknown, but there's one cool study about it - two groups of mice were given obesity-causing diets, and one of them was also supplemented with Evodia. The one with no supplementation had reached obesity, while the other lost 10% general mass and had 28% less perirenal fat (fat around the kidney)
* **Garlic:** Garlic is capable of softly increasing the secretion of noradrenaline while also being an overall wonder-supplement for body balance. You can find odorless softgels, which I find best for supplementation.
* **Fish Oil:** Isn't much of a weight loss pill per se, but it reduces stress and inflammation and therefore makes it easier to lose weight.
* **Spirulina:** 7% more weight loss was registered in the spirulina-supplementation group compared to the placebo group. Gym-goers should be aware of the fact that spirulina protein has shown better hypertrophy in some studies when compared to casein protein, so you might want to check into that. 
* **Yerba Mate:** One Yerba Mate and one Placebo group were put onto a 12-week program, with the results of 150 cm3 shredded from the Yerba Mate group’s visceral fat while the Placebo group had an increase of 200 cm3
* **Alpha-GPC:** Most of the effects of Alpha-GPC are directed towards a better cognition and support a decent upgrade in performance. Although its great effects are not focused on fat burning, studies show it does promote fat burning 2 hours after consumption.
* **Yohimbine:** Works by increasing adrenaline levels in the body and lowering some regulation processes which usually suppress fat burning. 2% more fat was lost after 3 weeks.
* **Eleutherococcus Senticosus:** a.k.a Siberian Ginseng is an adaptogenic herb which has been shown to increase work capacity during physically intense activities by preserving your body's reserves. It also promotes fat oxidation.
* **Ashwagandha:** This one's called the ""king of Ayurvedic medicine"". Being an adaptogen, it will make it much easier for you to get going with your diet and stick to it. An ""adaptogen"" is what makes your body and mind adapt easier and with less stress to new things you get going in your life. 2% more weight was lost by the Ashwagandha group compared to placebo.
* **5-HTP:** This one's also not specifically targeted towards fat loss, but it's the precursor to serotonin a.k.a the neurotransmitter involved in triggering positive emotions. Besides lowering appetite and therefore contributing to weight loss, the happy-state it brings also helps by making this path easier to go along. 
* **Black Cumin:** Spice frequently used in traditional medicine. Although it doesn’t have strong effects, it has many beneficial ones which make it a good tool to spice your diet with. Among them, of course, it’s been proven to promote weight loss by reducing appetite.
* **7-Keto DHEA:** 7-Keto DHEA was studied under a diet and exercise routine. The group taking 7-Keto DHEA lost 3 more 3kgs than those who didn't. Keep in mind that studies are not clear if this effect happens whether you diet and exercise or not. 2.88 extra kgs lost in comparison to the placebo group.
* **Coleus Forskohlii:** Herb traditionally used in Ayurvedic Medicine. It has shown promising effects as a fat burner and testosterone-booster. Its effects are most suited for men. 2.8% BMI reduction compared to placebo group.
* **Eurycoma Longifolia Jack:** Herb used as an aphrodisiac with pro-erectile and libido increasing effects. Although it’s mechanisms for fat loss are not completely known, progress has been noticed. It has also shown fantastic anti-estrogenic effects, putting itself forth as a top supplement for men.
* **Grapefruit:** is a tasty punch of active enzymes which promote fat burning by increasing metabolic rate. It has helped me throughout my weight loss journey and I must say, it’s a great supplement overall. Diet pills are usually called by its wonder compound name, **Hesperidin**. Over 2 weeks, 1.1kg more shredded through pills, 1.5kg through juice, 1.6kg through whole fruit.
* **Gynostemma Pentaphyllum (Southern Ginseng):** Works by raising the metabolic rate, making sure you destroy those calories (and hence, fat cells) faster than you normally would. Up to 8% more weight loss compared to placebo
* **Pterostilbene:** Kind of a *better Resveratrol*, with much better potency in most cases and better absorption. Having been only recently found, there are not many studies regarding it, yet the results look promising to say the least.
* **Rose Hip:** I cannot guarantee for this supplement, but it has some good benefits nonetheless, including an improvement in Skin Elasticity which helps if you have a lot of weight to shred and want to prevent loose skin. It's not thoroughly studied, but one study says that it'll increase weight loss with an extra kg per month.
* **Caralluma Fimbriata:** Its effects seem to appear only after around 1 month of supplementation. Although other benefits are unknown, it's a known-to-be great as an appetite suppressant.
* **Caffeine:** Some drink it out of love, some use it out of need. Nonetheless, this supplement has some great benefits to bring to the table, including thermogenesis (hence making you burn fat) and mental stimulation. Burns an extra 12-32 kcals/hour (So for 4 hours of an increased metabolism daily, that translates in 560 kcal per week), yet it only works if paired with a healthy diet and exercise program. 24 weeks of 200 mg supplementation brought no fat loss alone.
* **Berberine:** Seems to have anti-diabetic effects, while also promoting weight loss by reducing the development of fat cells and increasing their usage. Make sure you don't take these diet pills if you have diabetes, as they can mess up your blood sugar levels. 13% decrease in Body Mass Index
* **L-Carnitine:** It promotes usage of fat cells as an energy source, therefore being a great fat burn agent. ALCAR only works for those who have a deficiency in it.
* **Green Tea Catechins:** Specifically EGCG which is the most potent of the catechins. Amazing fat burner through thermogenesis and suppresses appetite as well. 5 more pounds lost in 90 days compared to placebo.
* **Green Coffee Extract:** Dr. Oz kinda exaggerated this one's effects, but it does provide a small increase in weight loss - 5 more pounds were lost over 12 weeks.
* **Guarana:** Has a higher content of caffeine than coffee beans and its properties are mainly derived from this. It has shown promising results as a fat loss agent, yet studies are still unclear if this is due to any special compounds or the caffeine itself.
* **Yacon:** Also known as the “diet potato” with the taste of a pear, is usually consumed as a syrup. Studies regarding it have shown some benefits towards intestinal health, with a slight appetite suppressing effect.
* **Saffron:** It seems to boost metabolism while also suppressing appetite. The downside is the way it plays with estrogen, potentially messing up both men and women. Wouldn't recommend you taking this supplement for long periods of time. Although estrogen is great for women, it seems to be linked to breast cancer when there's too much estrogen for too long. As always, play safely with every supplement you take.
* **Melatonin:** Supplementation is mainly used to improve the quality of sleep, but it brings great benefits including a slight reduction in BMI. This is most likely a side-effect caused by the better performance of the metabolism which is brought by a quality of sleep improvement. 0.2 BMI decrease compared to placebo.
* **Cissus Quadrangularis:** Cissus is mainly used by athletes for joint and bone health, but it's shown promise towards being a fat loss agent.
* **Fucoxanthin:** Promotes weight loss with a delay due to the need of a build-up inside the fat cells. Nonetheless, its results are quite promising and it might be a good supplement to add to your diet. 5 more kgs were lost over 16 weeks and an 11% decrease in liver fat was noted.
* **Licorice:** Chinese Medicine traditionally uses **Licorice** to treat digestive problems, while also increasing the quality of life. Supplementation has had great results towards weight loss, yet it does bring its downsides. Make sure you don't abuse this supplement, doing so has led to death. 10% reduction in body fat noted after 2 months.
* **Leptin, Ghrelin, Adiponectin:** Now, this is more of an honorable mention but it does deliver very well. I've had a leap of faith towards it and decided to buy this product and was quite amazed at the results. I usually pumped my leptin up through weekly cheat meals and while they did help, they would also damage my Calories In/Calories Out ratio, therefore one or two days of the week would end up unproductive. It's a product by Douglas laboratories I found on Amazon.
* **Turmeric:** In a nutshell, Turmeric is an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant supplement that provides you with an nourishment to your body. It brings better body balance and therefore, fewer cravings and more of an easy journey towards fat loss.

And there you have it!

I'm not calling this ""the ultimate resource on weight loss pills"" because I'm a self-absorbed prick, I do so because I couldn't find any other resource that offers as much detail as I did in the 20 days I spent on the subject.

I tried to keep it as short and sweet as possible for each of the supplements, and I hopefully managed to. If you'd like to find out more about each of them, such as their **other benefits, toxicity levels(although not many have them), how to take** them and the products I would recommend, you can find the **8000-words** post here:[ https://underloot.com/ultimate-resource-weight-loss-pills-that-actually-work/](https://underloot.com/ultimate-resource-weight-loss-pills-that-actually-work/)

**Disclaimer:** It **contains affiliate links** towards Amazon for each of the products.

Hope I could change a few minds on the matter. Wish you all the best on your journey, or congrats if you got there already!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a health&amp;amp;fitness blog writer, I started trying to advertise some of my first pieces on some facebook groups because I thought everyone would read them and aw my gawd how lucky I&amp;#39;d be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined a few of the most human-filled ones, and started checking what the people were talking about while also gloriously spamming them, and I honestly couldn&amp;#39;t believe my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were drinking and/or consuming &lt;strong&gt;countless &amp;quot;shortcut&amp;quot; products&lt;/strong&gt; that were supposed to help them lose weight while intoxicating their bodies in the most idiotic and harmful ways. The one thing they wouldn&amp;#39;t do was g&lt;strong&gt;et out of bed, eat a salad, and maybe take a walk for 20 minutes a day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They would prefer some sort of &lt;em&gt;magically poisonous tea&lt;/em&gt; that was supposed to help them lose weight while doing nothing instead of actually altering some of the bad habits they built up over the years in order to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those products was guava leaves tea. I never tried it, but the stories these people were telling - &lt;strong&gt;how they feel awful, are sweating the entire day, are vomiting and have diarrhea, but they&amp;#39;re losing pounds so that&amp;#39;s ok,&lt;/strong&gt; touched me to the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to research this topic of weight loss pills through (I&amp;#39;m not affiliated with them in any way)&lt;a href=""https://examine.com/""&gt; examine.com&lt;/a&gt; - if you haven&amp;#39;t heard about this website, it&amp;#39;s one of the most amazing websites I&amp;#39;ve had the honor to come across for anyone who takes supplements of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys compiled countless of studies into simple conclusions regarding one supplement or another - the ones that work and do a certain thing, and the ones that don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to curate this website for the weight loss pills that actually worked and could help with weight loss while they&amp;#39;re still healthy and worthy of consumption, and I realized one thing - most of the supplements that promise quick weight loss will harm your body in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplements are supplements and should be seen as such - an extra mile for every 10 miles worth of dieting and (hopefully) exercise. A bonus that&amp;#39;s aligned with the other efforts you&amp;#39;re making towards weight loss, not the way towards it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found 35 weight loss pills studies have shown that are actually linked to weight loss using examine. &lt;strong&gt;There may be more than these, and what I&amp;#39;m writing isn&amp;#39;t future-proof at all given the constantly-changing nature of science.&lt;/strong&gt; But the evidence so far shows that these actually help in losing an extra pound or two per month while also keeping your body &lt;strong&gt;clean and bulletproof.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go in-depth on each and every one of them, I&amp;#39;ll just give the rate of increase in weight loss for those of which I could find it and a few words about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resveratrol:&lt;/strong&gt; 3.2 extra pounds lost per month. Powerful anti-oxidant that shreds fat through an increase in thermogenesis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capsaicin:&lt;/strong&gt; The torturing element of hot peppers shows an 8% increase in weight loss, and it also works through thermogenesis. Best when taken 1 hour before exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evodia Fruit:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects are similar to Capsaicin, but it also reduces fat cell formation. The increase in weight loss rate is unknown, but there&amp;#39;s one cool study about it - two groups of mice were given obesity-causing diets, and one of them was also supplemented with Evodia. The one with no supplementation had reached obesity, while the other lost 10% general mass and had 28% less perirenal fat (fat around the kidney)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garlic:&lt;/strong&gt; Garlic is capable of softly increasing the secretion of noradrenaline while also being an overall wonder-supplement for body balance. You can find odorless softgels, which I find best for supplementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish Oil:&lt;/strong&gt; Isn&amp;#39;t much of a weight loss pill per se, but it reduces stress and inflammation and therefore makes it easier to lose weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirulina:&lt;/strong&gt; 7% more weight loss was registered in the spirulina-supplementation group compared to the placebo group. Gym-goers should be aware of the fact that spirulina protein has shown better hypertrophy in some studies when compared to casein protein, so you might want to check into that. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yerba Mate:&lt;/strong&gt; One Yerba Mate and one Placebo group were put onto a 12-week program, with the results of 150 cm3 shredded from the Yerba Mate group’s visceral fat while the Placebo group had an increase of 200 cm3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha-GPC:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the effects of Alpha-GPC are directed towards a better cognition and support a decent upgrade in performance. Although its great effects are not focused on fat burning, studies show it does promote fat burning 2 hours after consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yohimbine:&lt;/strong&gt; Works by increasing adrenaline levels in the body and lowering some regulation processes which usually suppress fat burning. 2% more fat was lost after 3 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eleutherococcus Senticosus:&lt;/strong&gt; a.k.a Siberian Ginseng is an adaptogenic herb which has been shown to increase work capacity during physically intense activities by preserving your body&amp;#39;s reserves. It also promotes fat oxidation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashwagandha:&lt;/strong&gt; This one&amp;#39;s called the &amp;quot;king of Ayurvedic medicine&amp;quot;. Being an adaptogen, it will make it much easier for you to get going with your diet and stick to it. An &amp;quot;adaptogen&amp;quot; is what makes your body and mind adapt easier and with less stress to new things you get going in your life. 2% more weight was lost by the Ashwagandha group compared to placebo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5-HTP:&lt;/strong&gt; This one&amp;#39;s also not specifically targeted towards fat loss, but it&amp;#39;s the precursor to serotonin a.k.a the neurotransmitter involved in triggering positive emotions. Besides lowering appetite and therefore contributing to weight loss, the happy-state it brings also helps by making this path easier to go along. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Cumin:&lt;/strong&gt; Spice frequently used in traditional medicine. Although it doesn’t have strong effects, it has many beneficial ones which make it a good tool to spice your diet with. Among them, of course, it’s been proven to promote weight loss by reducing appetite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7-Keto DHEA:&lt;/strong&gt; 7-Keto DHEA was studied under a diet and exercise routine. The group taking 7-Keto DHEA lost 3 more 3kgs than those who didn&amp;#39;t. Keep in mind that studies are not clear if this effect happens whether you diet and exercise or not. 2.88 extra kgs lost in comparison to the placebo group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coleus Forskohlii:&lt;/strong&gt; Herb traditionally used in Ayurvedic Medicine. It has shown promising effects as a fat burner and testosterone-booster. Its effects are most suited for men. 2.8% BMI reduction compared to placebo group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eurycoma Longifolia Jack:&lt;/strong&gt; Herb used as an aphrodisiac with pro-erectile and libido increasing effects. Although it’s mechanisms for fat loss are not completely known, progress has been noticed. It has also shown fantastic anti-estrogenic effects, putting itself forth as a top supplement for men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grapefruit:&lt;/strong&gt; is a tasty punch of active enzymes which promote fat burning by increasing metabolic rate. It has helped me throughout my weight loss journey and I must say, it’s a great supplement overall. Diet pills are usually called by its wonder compound name, &lt;strong&gt;Hesperidin&lt;/strong&gt;. Over 2 weeks, 1.1kg more shredded through pills, 1.5kg through juice, 1.6kg through whole fruit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gynostemma Pentaphyllum (Southern Ginseng):&lt;/strong&gt; Works by raising the metabolic rate, making sure you destroy those calories (and hence, fat cells) faster than you normally would. Up to 8% more weight loss compared to placebo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pterostilbene:&lt;/strong&gt; Kind of a &lt;em&gt;better Resveratrol&lt;/em&gt;, with much better potency in most cases and better absorption. Having been only recently found, there are not many studies regarding it, yet the results look promising to say the least.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rose Hip:&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot guarantee for this supplement, but it has some good benefits nonetheless, including an improvement in Skin Elasticity which helps if you have a lot of weight to shred and want to prevent loose skin. It&amp;#39;s not thoroughly studied, but one study says that it&amp;#39;ll increase weight loss with an extra kg per month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caralluma Fimbriata:&lt;/strong&gt; Its effects seem to appear only after around 1 month of supplementation. Although other benefits are unknown, it&amp;#39;s a known-to-be great as an appetite suppressant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine:&lt;/strong&gt; Some drink it out of love, some use it out of need. Nonetheless, this supplement has some great benefits to bring to the table, including thermogenesis (hence making you burn fat) and mental stimulation. Burns an extra 12-32 kcals/hour (So for 4 hours of an increased metabolism daily, that translates in 560 kcal per week), yet it only works if paired with a healthy diet and exercise program. 24 weeks of 200 mg supplementation brought no fat loss alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berberine:&lt;/strong&gt; Seems to have anti-diabetic effects, while also promoting weight loss by reducing the development of fat cells and increasing their usage. Make sure you don&amp;#39;t take these diet pills if you have diabetes, as they can mess up your blood sugar levels. 13% decrease in Body Mass Index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L-Carnitine:&lt;/strong&gt; It promotes usage of fat cells as an energy source, therefore being a great fat burn agent. ALCAR only works for those who have a deficiency in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Tea Catechins:&lt;/strong&gt; Specifically EGCG which is the most potent of the catechins. Amazing fat burner through thermogenesis and suppresses appetite as well. 5 more pounds lost in 90 days compared to placebo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Coffee Extract:&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Oz kinda exaggerated this one&amp;#39;s effects, but it does provide a small increase in weight loss - 5 more pounds were lost over 12 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guarana:&lt;/strong&gt; Has a higher content of caffeine than coffee beans and its properties are mainly derived from this. It has shown promising results as a fat loss agent, yet studies are still unclear if this is due to any special compounds or the caffeine itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yacon:&lt;/strong&gt; Also known as the “diet potato” with the taste of a pear, is usually consumed as a syrup. Studies regarding it have shown some benefits towards intestinal health, with a slight appetite suppressing effect.&lt;/li&gt;

Although estrogen is great for women, it seems to be linked to breast cancer when there&amp;#39;s too much estrogen for too long. As always, play safely with every supplement you take.&lt;/li&gt;

This is most likely a side-effect caused by the better performance of the metabolism which is brought by a quality of sleep improvement. 0.2 BMI decrease compared to placebo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cissus Quadrangularis:&lt;/strong&gt; Cissus is mainly used by athletes for joint and bone health, but it&amp;#39;s shown promise towards being a fat loss agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fucoxanthin:&lt;/strong&gt; Promotes weight loss with a delay due to the need of a build-up inside the fat cells. Nonetheless, its results are quite promising and it might be a good supplement to add to your diet. 5 more kgs were lost over 16 weeks and an 11% decrease in liver fat was noted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Licorice:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese Medicine traditionally uses &lt;strong&gt;Licorice&lt;/strong&gt; to treat digestive problems, while also increasing the quality of life. Supplementation has had great results towards weight loss, yet it does bring its downsides. Make sure you don&amp;#39;t abuse this supplement, doing so has led to death. 10% reduction in body fat noted after 2 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leptin, Ghrelin, Adiponectin:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, this is more of an honorable mention but it does deliver very well. I&amp;#39;ve had a leap of faith towards it and decided to buy this product and was quite amazed at the results. I usually pumped my leptin up through weekly cheat meals and while they did help, they would also damage my Calories In/Calories Out ratio, therefore one or two days of the week would end up unproductive. It&amp;#39;s a product by Douglas laboratories I found on Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;

My unhealthy addiction is chocolate, I mean I eat around 500g chocolate everyday! I need some advice!

About me, I came from a broken house, so not everyday there was any food on the table. I was also bullied at school and at home for years.
I think my addiction started that I wanted to feel better, to feel happy. And eat somthing!
I have carried this habbit and safe ""feeling"" to my adulthood. 
I eat a normal dinner then I eat chocolate after. That is one of my problems!! 

What happen when I do not eat any chocolate? I get headaches, I can't relax, I feel weak, stressed, hungry and shaking all the time. 
And easily get anxiety attacks! 

What I wish I could get any help is, a tight everyday food list. Maybe anti-suger pills? And that someone can take my addiction seriously!

I am 23 year old female. My process of body transformation began in 2016. Until then I'd never worked out. I joined a gym and started with weight training program. Along with it, a proper diet in which I used to count my calories. I was damn motivated. Avoided rice( which I like and it's staple food of my state).
This continued for about a year and half. I lost about 10 kgs. Got all time fit with proper body shape.
But in December 2017, due to anxiety issues and some problems in my life, I was on medication. The doctor suggested to eat 'everything' and gain some weight. 
It's been a year since then I haven't been able to keep up with fitness and diet. I wonder how motivated I was then (one of the reason is health was my priority and now life has happened).
I Started eating rice. I came to my original state again. I do try to start cardio or workout session or dieting, But I struggle with continuing it. And sometimes I binge eat.

I'm a 5""10 female who currently weighs waaay more than I should.
I'm 24 and think it's about time I take control of my body... but I'm not really sure where to even start.

I come from a family of very big woman, and my mother never really taught us healthy eating habits-- when I was a kid I just devoured whatever was in front of me, cause we were a poor household that went without a lot.

Now as an adult I have my own place, a loving boyfriend and a great job that I enjoy-- 
But I really want the confidence to love my body and not have such a hard time buying clothing that fits me.

Im such a noob at anything health, yes I know I should probably not have sugar and eat more veggies-- 
But as easy as it sounds, it truly isn't.
Where do I start? 
I would love some advice for my new adventure of a healthier and brighter future.

I'm a software developer and I got a stomach I'm trying to lose. As someone who has about 6 weeks at the gym, my trainer is telling me how important a diet is to my success.

So I'm down a rabbit hole of learning about the ""Low-Carb Diet"" with Intermittent Fasting, and others such as Keto / Atkins Diet. Now, I want to commit but if I start one:

Just tell me what to eat, when to eat, and motivate me to stick with it. When searching I just see a bunch of ""buy this or subscribe here"" to get your weekly meals/shopping list. I don't know why there isn't an easy way for people to share the journey for each of these diets with some meal planning.

**My Goal:**

A quick website that I can finish in a few weekends that:

* Has an easy weekly meal guide for the diet with a how to get started.
* Users can submit new recipes to a diet.
* Maybe a way to have threaded conversations with other people for support. May just create a subreddit. I don't know.

I may even live code it.. online.

The goal is I want to build something that will be free forever and it will be super easy for someone who wants to diet, pick one and have meals/shopping list of recipes sent to them. Good pintrest like view of meals. 

The whole code base will be open source and free forever.

While I support any diet that works, here's what I found out about how cavemen \*really\* ate. 

""Modern chickens, cows, sheep, and goats are plumper, more placid, and genetically different from their feral ancestors. Paleolithic fruit, though often smaller and tarter than modern varieties, was recognizably fruit. Apples, grapes, figs, plums, and pears have been tempting mammals for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years.  ... Ancient tomatoes were the size of berries; potatoes were no bigger than peanuts. Corn was a wild grass, its tooth-cracking kernels borne in clusters as small as pencil erasers. Cucumbers were spiny as sea urchins; lettuce was bitter and prickly. Peas were so starchy and unpalatable that, before eating, they had to be roasted like chestnuts and peeled. The sole available cabbage—the great-great-granddaddy of today’s kale, kohlrabi, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower—was sea kale, a tough and tongue-curling leafy weed that grew along the temperate sea coasts. Carrots were scrawny. Beans were naturally laced with cyanide. ... The vegetables that grace every salad bar today are latecomers. Vegetables didn’t really get off or out of the ground until the Neolithic Period, the [civilized tail end of the Stone Age](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130423-european-genetic-history-dna-archaeology-science/), generally said to have begun about 10,000 years ago."" (Cheese, which is not allowed with paleo because dairy is not allowed, was consumed before 6000 BC.)

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, we do have a modern-day caveman, namely the Hiwi tribe. I'm not clear how much meat vs. plants they eat, but the variety (which doesn't include anything most Westerners eat) is quite varied.

""Fish trapped in shrinking pools of water are easy targets for caiman, capybaras and turtles. In turn, the desiccating lakes become prime hunting territory for the Hiwi. During the wet season, however, the Hiwi mainly hunt for animals in the forest, using bows and arrows.

The Hiwi gather and hunt a diverse group of plants and animals from the savannas, forests, rivers and swamps. Their main sources of meat are capybara, collared peccary, deer, anteater, armadillo, and feral cattle, numerous species of fish, and at least some turtle species. Less commonly consumed animals include iguanas and savanna lizards, wild rabbits, and many birds. Not exactly the kind of meat Paleo dieters and others in urban areas can easily obtain.

Five roots, both bitter and sweet, are staples in the Hiwi diet, as are palm nuts and palm hearts, several different fruits, a wild legume named *Campsiandra comosa*, and honey produced by several bee species and sometimes by wasps. A few Hiwi families tend small, scattered and largely unproductive fields of plantains, corn and squash. At neighboring cattle ranches in a town about 30 kilometers away, some Hiwi buy rice, noodles, corn flour and sugar. Anthropologists and tourists have also given the Hiwi similar processed foods as gifts (see illustration at top).

Hill and Hurtado calculated that foods hunted and collected in the wild account for 95 percent of the Hiwi's total caloric intake; the remaining 5 percent comes from store-bought goods as well as from fruits and squash gathered from the Hiwi's small fields. They rely more on purchased goods during the peak of the dry season.

The Hiwi are not particularly healthy. Compared to the Ache, a hunter–gatherer tribe in Paraguay, the Hiwi are shorter, thinner, more lethargic and less well nourished. Hiwi men and women of all ages constantly complain of hunger. Many Hiwi are heavily infected with parasitic hookworms, which burrow into the small intestine and feed on blood. And only 50 percent of Hiwi children survive beyond the age of 15.

Dates and armadillo. It's what's for dinner. :D","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re familiar with anything from vegetable monoculture to turkeys whose breasts are so large they can&amp;#39;t have sex, you may suspect that today&amp;#39;s selection of foods only have in common with caveman food in pretty much name only. While I support any diet that works, here&amp;#39;s what I found out about how cavemen *really* ate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Modern chickens, cows, sheep, and goats are plumper, more placid, and genetically different from their feral ancestors. Paleolithic fruit, though often smaller and tarter than modern varieties, was recognizably fruit. Apples, grapes, figs, plums, and pears have been tempting mammals for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years.  ... Ancient tomatoes were the size of berries; potatoes were no bigger than peanuts. Corn was a wild grass, its tooth-cracking kernels borne in clusters as small as pencil erasers. Cucumbers were spiny as sea urchins; lettuce was bitter and prickly. Peas were so starchy and unpalatable that, before eating, they had to be roasted like chestnuts and peeled. The sole available cabbage—the great-great-granddaddy of today’s kale, kohlrabi, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower—was sea kale, a tough and tongue-curling leafy weed that grew along the temperate sea coasts. Carrots were scrawny. Beans were naturally laced with cyanide. ... The vegetables that grace every salad bar today are latecomers. Vegetables didn’t really get off or out of the ground until the Neolithic Period, the &lt;a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130423-european-genetic-history-dna-archaeology-science/""&gt;civilized tail end of the Stone Age&lt;/a&gt;, generally said to have begun about 10,000 years ago.&amp;quot; (Cheese, which is not allowed with paleo because dairy is not allowed, was consumed before 6000 BC.) &lt;a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2014/04/22/prehistoric-dining-the-real-paleo-diet/?user.testname=none""&gt;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2014/04/22/prehistoric-dining-the-real-paleo-diet/?user.testname=none&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we do have a modern-day caveman, namely the Hiwi tribe. I&amp;#39;m not clear how much meat vs. plants they eat, but the variety (which doesn&amp;#39;t include anything most Westerners eat) is quite varied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fish trapped in shrinking pools of water are easy targets for caiman, capybaras and turtles. In turn, the desiccating lakes become prime hunting territory for the Hiwi. During the wet season, however, the Hiwi mainly hunt for animals in the forest, using bows and arrows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hiwi gather and hunt a diverse group of plants and animals from the savannas, forests, rivers and swamps. Their main sources of meat are capybara, collared peccary, deer, anteater, armadillo, and feral cattle, numerous species of fish, and at least some turtle species. Less commonly consumed animals include iguanas and savanna lizards, wild rabbits, and many birds. Not exactly the kind of meat Paleo dieters and others in urban areas can easily obtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five roots, both bitter and sweet, are staples in the Hiwi diet, as are palm nuts and palm hearts, several different fruits, a wild legume named &lt;em&gt;Campsiandra comosa&lt;/em&gt;, and honey produced by several bee species and sometimes by wasps. A few Hiwi families tend small, scattered and largely unproductive fields of plantains, corn and squash. At neighboring cattle ranches in a town about 30 kilometers away, some Hiwi buy rice, noodles, corn flour and sugar. Anthropologists and tourists have also given the Hiwi similar processed foods as gifts (see illustration at top).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hill and Hurtado calculated that foods hunted and collected in the wild account for 95 percent of the Hiwi&amp;#39;s total caloric intake; the remaining 5 percent comes from store-bought goods as well as from fruits and squash gathered from the Hiwi&amp;#39;s small fields. They rely more on purchased goods during the peak of the dry season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hiwi are not particularly healthy. Compared to the Ache, a hunter–gatherer tribe in Paraguay, the Hiwi are shorter, thinner, more lethargic and less well nourished. Hiwi men and women of all ages constantly complain of hunger. Many Hiwi are heavily infected with parasitic hookworms, which burrow into the small intestine and feed on blood. And only 50 percent of Hiwi children survive beyond the age of 15. &amp;quot; &lt;a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-paleo-diet-half-baked-how-hunter-gatherer-really-eat/""&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-paleo-diet-half-baked-how-hunter-gatherer-really-eat/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

7:30AM- breakfast #2 when I get to work 2 hard boiled eggs over a bed of lettuce (the 50/50 spring mix kind.. about 1.5cups) spritz of olive oil spray and a little bit of salt for flavor

Sometimes I do yoga after work maybe 1-2x/week depending on how I feel, but for the most part I just go home (sit in traffic for a long time) and go to sleep after I get off work.

So we started to watch documentaries and eat better. Gluten free and dairy free helped me greatly. 

My husband has Hashi's we found out after basically a mental breakdown. 

Anyway to the eating disorder. He latches on to these non doctor internet people like Dave Asprey and Thomas Delaur and others.

He is constantly trying to fix his low energy levels. Note he refuses to take the medicine for the Hashimotos. He went on this coffee diet and was drinking a huge jar of bulletproof coffee along with his Adderall and not eating anything until dinner. He was rail thin.

After this he went to work for my step dad and couldn't handle the job. Lasted three months. Then went to work for his dad. Which lasted a few months. 

His latest version of the disordered diet is basically alcoholism IMO. He drinks like 4-6 Coors lights daily because it helps 'his joints not hurt"" eats half a bag of corn chips at night along with half a package of processed lunch meat chicken and cheese and roasted nut mix. He doesn't wake up until 11 am it takes him two hours to get ready. He takes a handful of vitamins on an empty stomach then had a protein shake with milk, some kind of veggie powder and whey protein and then another handful of vitamins. 

He is severely diffecient in potassium. He refuses to eat sweet potato, regular potato, raisins, apricots, rice, beans, onions, peppers tomatoes.

Seriously WTF can I cook without these ingredients?!

This diet issue is so annoying. We have been married almost 11 years we have 3 kids one of whom is only 6 months old. So leaving him isn't an option. He won't listen to reason. This diet is going to kill him

I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;quot;4 22yo woman and I&amp;#39;ve lost around 15 pounds from 20 i wanted to lose. I&amp;#39;ve been noticing very frustrating weight fluctuations that have hindered me in shedding the remaining 5 lbs. 
I understand that food weight will put temporary weight on the scale since you have a belly full of food, but I&amp;#39;m the type of person who takes 3 bites out of her food and the scale punishes me with 3lbs heavier when I&amp;#39;m starting to get excited about being so close to my goal. It&amp;#39;s even more infuriating since the weight can stick to me for several days. 
I&amp;#39;m still doing my cardio and weights and I&amp;#39;ve been trying to keep my portions small but Im afraid of indulging once in a while because i wake up gaining double of what i lost and i was wondering if it was normal or if I&amp;#39;m doing something wrong. I&amp;#39;ve been in this plateu for about a month now. &lt;/p&gt;

""One of the most common missteps I see that keeps people from getting results is being afraid to get hungry.

Intense hunger, when you can't concentrate, you're irritable, and you want to shove the first thing you see into your mouth, doesn’t feel good. But mild to moderate hunger is normal, and it's something you should be experiencing about four times a day. It’s a signal that your metabolism is in gear, that you’ve used up or burned off the previous meal and that it’s time to refuel for the hours ahead.

Many of my clients eat on a schedule, which is great, but they’re never really hungry, which is an indication that they’re eating too much.""

""Brigitte Zeitlin, M.P.H., R.D., C.D.N., founder of the New York-based BZ Nutrition, recommends getting into the habit of ranking your hunger on a scale from one to 10. ""A one is being completely full, and a 10 is being so hungry you want to rip your arm off and eat it just to satiate yourself,"" she tells SELF. So, a big difference!

The hunger sweet spot is anywhere from a five to seven on this scale, says Zeitlin. That’s where you should be when you eat a meal or a snack. ""If you're feeling something between an eight to 10, you'll overeat,"" she explains. ""At a five to seven, you're feeling hungry enough to eat but still in control of how much you're eating.""

eating 3 servings of fresh veggies a day, as well as rice and lots of home made moroccan dishes (bought myself a cook book and started cooking dishes from there, all are relatively healthy)

2 tsp Peanutbutter
Some Unsweetend Almondmilk

I&amp;#39;m in OK shape ( 85 KG ) but my goal is to create a healthier lifestyle, drop fat, get more muscle, and try to eat like 3 meals a day(Breakfast, lunch, dinner). Carb-free dinner, but some carbs at breakfast ans lunch is my goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my job, we have free breakfast. It&amp;#39;s mostly sandwiches, tho. And i don&amp;#39;t feel like eating white bread every morning is a great idea. So breakfast at home it is, and lazy as i am i want it to be fast, easy, good tasting and make me feel full until lunch time. Maybe shake will be a good idea? Is this a decent shake idea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1-2 Banana(depending on size)
2 tsp Peanutbutter
Some Unsweetend Almondmilk
Ice
And maybe 1/2 - 1 scoop Protein powder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this last me until lunch, and is it a decent shake? Do you have any to-go shakes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR
Is my shake good or should i eat something else.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, so last week I decided It was time that I pay more attention to what I’m eating (I’ve gained a lot of weight in the last couple of months, and It was starting to effect me mentally.). I calculated where my weight should be for my age and height and confirmed my goal was to lose 35 pounds to look/feel better and healthier.  I researched a lot of different diets and found them to be super restrictive..ended up choosing a calorie counting diet because I didn’t want to restrict WHAT I eat.  I love carbs, and sugars and I knew if I tried to cut those things out significantly I would fail.  I’ve done pretty well this week with It.  Basically, I’m allowed 1200 calories per day, which has worked during the week because I can plan my meals between a busy work/school schedule and I don’t have the time to really think about cravings.  However, I didn’t plan for this weekend.  It’s now Saturday, and I kind of screwed up.  Usually I split my calories so that I have an equal amount of calories to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  But come today, and I gave in to my cravings for sweets and ate more than half of my calories already and it’s only noon...meaning I’ll either have to skip lunch, dinner, or have a less-than-filling meal for both.   Basically, I guess my question to everyone is how do you handle bad-food cravings without straying from your regimen?  I don’t really want this to happen again, and I’m stressing over basically having to starve myself the rest of the day because of this mistake..

There’s been a lot of talk in recent years about intermittent fasting and the benefits of it but is it all it’s cracked up to be. We’ll take an independent unbiased look at the latest phenomenon and the science behind it. 

**What actually is intermittent fasting?**

Rather than being a diet as such intermittent fasting is more of an eating pattern whereby you cycle between periods of fasting and eating. Instead of saying what you can and can’t eat it’s more when you can and when you can’t eat. There are many reasons why people turn to this and although weight loss is the most common some of the other reasons may surprise you.

**The history of fasting**

The practice of fasting is actually a very old one. Back in the days of prehistoric man we didn’t have refrigerators and grocery stores to help stave of our hunger. In fact we didn’t always know when our next meal was so our bodies developed accordingly. In the past sixty or so years we’ve invented all sorts of ways of keeping food fresh and on tap so to speak. Yet evolutionarily speaking this is a very short period of time, way to short for our bodies to adapt to. So with this newly found excess of food our bodies do the only thing they can with it – they store if incase that was the last meal for a week. Now although this is good keeping hunger at bay it’s having a bad effect on our health which has lead to the rise in popularity of fasting.

**Is fasting good for you?**

Okay so we’ve established that fasting can be good for you but how good is it really? Well various studies over the years have highlighted a large number of benefits, from the obvious ones like losing weight to the not so obvious ones of helping to ward of things like Alzheimer’s. While everybody is different and won’t necessarily benefit in the same way as other people here are some of the most common health benefits.

* Weight loss, ask anybody why they’re fasting and you’ll find that the vast majority of them are fasting for weight loss
* Insulin resistance which can results in lower your blood sugar levels to such level that studies have shown that it can help to protect against type 2 diabetes
* Improved heart health can be achieved by reducing your bad LDL cholesterol
* Fasting can improve your brain function by increasing your BDNF hormone which encourages new nerve cell growth and therefore helping to protect against Alzheimer’s
* In studies using rats, the ones that were fasting showing and increased life span of between 36% and 83%
* Human Growth Hormone (HGH) can increase as much as 5 fold which is a key factor in fat loss and muscle gain
* Increased cell repair because fasting will encourage the operation of autophagy which is the process were cells are digested and old protein build up is removed.

**Fasting methods**

So you’ve decided you’re going to try intermittent fasting, but which method. While there are a number of different fasting methods they all follow the same principles of fasting and eating. The three most popular methods are:

* Leangains protocol (or 16:8 method) – the most popular and easiest one to sick to the leangains protocol means you skip breakfast and then restrict your daily eating period to 8 hours then fast for 16 hours.
* Eat-Stop-Eat is pretty much as it sounds, you eat normally but will fast completely once or twice a week. This is sometimes known as 24 hours fasting
* 5:2 diet was made popular by the BBC programme Horizon and is a mixture of the other two. On two non-consecutive days you’re restricting your calorie intake to between 500 and 600 calories then on the other days you’ll eat normally.

The key to fasting though is you must not over compensate for your reduced intake by overeating on non fasting days.

**How do you break a fast?**

A very common question that people ask is what should I eat when I do break my fast. There’s no one answer to this and is dependant on a number of factors such as the method you’re using and to a large extent how you feel. While a lot of people will break their fast with a big hearty breakfast a lot of people will prefer to have a simple protein shake or bowl of porridge. What you choose is down to you although it is worth bearing in mind that liquids will be absorbed into your body a lot faster than solids.

**Conclusion**

There’s no ‘one size fits all’ fasting plan and it certainly isn’t for everybody. Some people will see huge changes from one method but no change from another method. That said if you can find a method or adapt a method that suits you there are innumerable benefits from this. Before you do consider any type of fasting though you should seek medical advice and also take into account you end goal.

**Treat yourself**

Just because you’re fasting it doesn’t mean that your food has to be boring. There are a large number of [recipes](http://www.smartproteins.co.uk/news/recipes) out there to give you a very health balanced diet. You can even get some great [proteins](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?s=2151916&amp;v=6618&amp;q=335896&amp;r=252907) that are especially designed to be used in recipes.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is fasting really good for you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm a 34 year old mom of a 1.5 year old. I stay home and do all the housework and dad has a full time job, paying the bills. We don't make a lot of money, but we're happy for the most part. I do the budgeting and we usually spend about $200-$250 per month on food. I'm generally really proud of my ability to make that work for all of us. 

Thing is, we often eat crappy food because it's what I know works in the budget, or that dad and son are willing to eat. Most of it's good. We eat a lot of broccoli (I get the big frozen bags), chicken, tilapia (big bag of frozen fillets are about $10), whole wheat bread only. I'm lactose intolerant so I don't drink milk, but we use 2% for cooking. I rarely fry food because we can't really afford virgin olive oil (my preference) and I hate the taste of vegetable oil. We do eat a lot of rice casseroles so rice is probably our biggest carb (aside from those rushed ramen lunches). Just plain white rice in bulk. I can't seem to find very good deals on brown rice (only nearby store is a Walmart). Bananas are highly popular treats in our home.

Dad is husky, but not huge. He's lost a hell of a lot of weight living with me, but it seems like we've both kind of hit a plateau. I'm generally too exhausted chasing around the toddler and doing chores all day to bother even trying to get in exercise and dad would probably die before he has to run anywhere. Taking the little guy to the convenience store for random stuff at a jog is the most I usually get. At the very least, I'd really like to get us on a healthier, more versatile diet. 

I'm 5'4, 115lbs. That doesn't seem like much, but I don't have a lot of muscle mass. I have love handles for the first time and I really hate it. I've always been a size 3, but ever since the baby I'm stuck around size 5-6. 

So I know this is long winded, but if anyone has any suggestions or could help me by reworking our shopping list into a $200-$250 budget I will freaking worship the ground you walk on. Even exercises I can do with the little guy. I used to jump rope but we live in apartments now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys.

We don&amp;#39;t make a lot of money, but we&amp;#39;re happy for the most part. I do the budgeting and we usually spend about $200-$250 per month on food. I&amp;#39;m generally really proud of my ability to make that work for all of us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is, we often eat crappy food because it&amp;#39;s what I know works in the budget, or that dad and son are willing to eat. Most of it&amp;#39;s good. We eat a lot of broccoli (I get the big frozen bags), chicken, tilapia (big bag of frozen fillets are about $10), whole wheat bread only. I&amp;#39;m lactose intolerant so I don&amp;#39;t drink milk, but we use 2% for cooking. I rarely fry food because we can&amp;#39;t really afford virgin olive oil (my preference) and I hate the taste of vegetable oil. We do eat a lot of rice casseroles so rice is probably our biggest carb (aside from those rushed ramen lunches). Just plain white rice in bulk. I can&amp;#39;t seem to find very good deals on brown rice (only nearby store is a Walmart). Bananas are highly popular treats in our home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad is husky, but not huge. He&amp;#39;s lost a hell of a lot of weight living with me, but it seems like we&amp;#39;ve both kind of hit a plateau. I&amp;#39;m generally too exhausted chasing around the toddler and doing chores all day to bother even trying to get in exercise and dad would probably die before he has to run anywhere. Taking the little guy to the convenience store for random stuff at a jog is the most I usually get. At the very least, I&amp;#39;d really like to get us on a healthier, more versatile diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;4, 115lbs. That doesn&amp;#39;t seem like much, but I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of muscle mass. I have love handles for the first time and I really hate it. I&amp;#39;ve always been a size 3, but ever since the baby I&amp;#39;m stuck around size 5-6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I know this is long winded, but if anyone has any suggestions or could help me by reworking our shopping list into a $200-$250 budget I will freaking worship the ground you walk on. Even exercises I can do with the little guy. I used to jump rope but we live in apartments now.&lt;/p&gt;

Hey how's everyone doing just wanted to get some feedback on something. About 3 months ago I started a diet, basically nothing fancy. Smoothie in the morning, maybe a banana and some oatmeal, a sub sandwich for lunch, a salad at night and another small meal.

So I did this strict for about 3 months straight. Not really deviating from it. About a month and a half into it I noticed I start to get really fatigued. I did not attributed to my diet I thought it was for other reasons. The fatigue continued for another two months. I still went about and try to eat healthy.

Today it just got to a point where like I could barely get out of bed and I'm completely stumped. Now I tried different things like having cheat days and cheat meals.  I've had so many things I even went to the doctor, I'm still trying to figure this out. I noticed on the days I had cheat meals for a couple days it seem like I was starting to normalize.






A weird thing is that a cheat meal that has sodium or saturated fats like a cheeseburger or even a Del Taco, seems to give me a positive boost.

So I kind of had to give up on my diet for now and I'm just going to eat whatever my body tells me at the moment. I just had a cheeseburger meal with some fries and noticed that my emotional and physical state kind of returned a little bit. I'm still tired though. But I'm thinking if I just eat enough calories for the next couple days I'll be fine.

I'm not really sure if it was because I had here to a very strict diet regiment or if I was not getting enough calories. I'm beginning to question the whole concept of eating healthy, and wondering if we're not supposed to mix in some regular food with our healthy food. Maybe eat whatever you want three days out of the week mix it in with some healthy food.

I do avoid excessive amounts of sugar in fact I rarely have sugar. Because of this, I think my healthy diet as well as haven't really been drinking or eating sugar brought me into a state of hypoglycemia. Truth is I don't really know but I know that this strict healthy diet had me barely getting up out of bed so I'm just bouncing this off of people to get some opinions.

To be honest now I'm afraid of getting back on this diet because it's weird. Why would I feel better on fast food in shape? I basically ate whatever I wanted two years before this, fast food cheeseburgers pizza and I was fine. Still could be active Etc. Then I start eating healthy and I get to a point where I can't even get out of bed? Makes no sense to me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey how&amp;#39;s everyone doing just wanted to get some feedback on something.

I am the lightest I've ever been but i am unfortunately hitting A LOT of plateaus as i lose more and more weight.

The past two weeks i am eating the same foods everyday (except lunch wich varies) and surprisingly it doesn't bore me and helps me stay focused. But I've noticed that i feel less energetic and tired all the time...

Could you help me figure out what i am doing wrong?

With all of these new trends it can be really difficult to keep up with everything but, more importantly, to know which ones work and which ones don’t.

* Carb-cycling
* Intermittent fasting
* Splitting meals
* High protein
* Rainbow diet

**Carb-cycling**:

Carb-cycling is the newest kid on the block but what does it actually mean. There are various different ways of cycling your carbs but to put it simply you alternate your diet between no or low carbs, low or moderate carbs and high carbs. So on day one your carb intake will be no or low, some people find it too difficult to cut this natural energy source out completely. The next day will either be low or moderate carbs, depending on the day before. The third day in the cycle involves a high carb intake. This is then repeated. The science behind this is simple, we all need carbs to function, they give us energy, strength and generally help us get through the day. Too many carbs though means your body can’t get rid of it quick enough so you won’t loose weight and gain muscle. Too little and your body doesn’t have what it needs to get through the day. By varying your intake like this you body can burn through what it has but doesn’t have enough to store, the result is a more lean and toned body.

**Intermittent fasting**:

This by no means a new trend and has been around a lot longer than you might think. Everybody has their own take on it but the general consensus is that the 5:2 method is the most effective. While this method won’t work for everybody the idea is that two days in every week you limit you calorie intake to a minimum and consume them all in one meal. Other methods of intermittent fasting are the 24 hour fast. Usually starting after your evening meal you will then not eat anything and drink only water until the next evening. Some people find this very difficult to do and instead will either have a small meal mid way through or only fast for 16 – 20 hours.

**Splitting meals:**

Exactly as it sounds, splitting meals means that instead of having three set meals through the day you take in the same number of calories but split them across the day. So if you have porridge, fruit and a protein shake for breakfast then have the porridge first then around 2 hours later have the fruit and protein shake. Likewise split your lunch and dinner into two meals each and space them evenly apart. While this can work for some people it doesn’t give your body time to digest the food properly before the next meal. This in turn leads to your insulin spiking which can have a detrimental effect on you weight loss.

**High protein:**

A high protein diet really is as straightforward as it sounds. Your body needs protein in order to develop and repair muscle so increasing you protein intake will naturally help with this. It is very important to make sure you don’t reduce your fat and carb intake at the same time as in their own way are very much needed by your body and it’s muscle development.

**Rainbow diet:**

This probably the most wacky of all of these trends but as crazy as it may sound there is some evidence to back it up. As kids we were all told to eat our greens but other ‘coloured’ fruits and vegetables have their own benefits too. We all know that greens are very high in antioxidants which can help to reduce a wide range of cancers and other health problems. Orange and yellow foods are known to reduce the risk of macular degeneration which can lead to blindness in old age. Blue foods, the most common of which is blueberries, help to protect you heart from disease as well as reducing you bad (LDL) cholesterol and increasing your good (HDL) cholesterol. Red foods are known to cut your risk of prostate, breast, skin, lung and neck cancer. Purple food such as figs, black raspberries and grapes are so good for you they’re even being used for possible cancer treatments.

**Conclusion:**

As with all diets everybody is different and what works for one person doesn’t necessarily work for somebody else. Don’t lose heart if you try one and don’t see the results you were expecting. It takes time for any change in diet to show results. It also requires a degree of experimentation with these methods to find the right solution for you.

&lt;p&gt;This by no means a new trend and has been around a lot longer than you might think. Everybody has their own take on it but the general consensus is that the 5:2 method is the most effective. While this method won’t work for everybody the idea is that two days in every week you limit you calorie intake to a minimum and consume them all in one meal. Other methods of intermittent fasting are the 24 hour fast. Usually starting after your evening meal you will then not eat anything and drink only water until the next evening. Some people find this very difficult to do and instead will either have a small meal mid way through or only fast for 16 – 20 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splitting meals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly as it sounds, splitting meals means that instead of having three set meals through the day you take in the same number of calories but split them across the day. So if you have porridge, fruit and a protein shake for breakfast then have the porridge first then around 2 hours later have the fruit and protein shake. Likewise split your lunch and dinner into two meals each and space them evenly apart. While this can work for some people it doesn’t give your body time to digest the food properly before the next meal. This in turn leads to your insulin spiking which can have a detrimental effect on you weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High protein:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high protein diet really is as straightforward as it sounds. Your body needs protein in order to develop and repair muscle so increasing you protein intake will naturally help with this. It is very important to make sure you don’t reduce your fat and carb intake at the same time as in their own way are very much needed by your body and it’s muscle development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rainbow diet:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably the most wacky of all of these trends but as crazy as it may sound there is some evidence to back it up. As kids we were all told to eat our greens but other ‘coloured’ fruits and vegetables have their own benefits too. We all know that greens are very high in antioxidants which can help to reduce a wide range of cancers and other health problems. Orange and yellow foods are known to reduce the risk of macular degeneration which can lead to blindness in old age. Blue foods, the most common of which is blueberries, help to protect you heart from disease as well as reducing you bad (LDL) cholesterol and increasing your good (HDL) cholesterol. Red foods are known to cut your risk of prostate, breast, skin, lung and neck cancer. Purple food such as figs, black raspberries and grapes are so good for you they’re even being used for possible cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all diets everybody is different and what works for one person doesn’t necessarily work for somebody else. Don’t lose heart if you try one and don’t see the results you were expecting. It takes time for any change in diet to show results. It also requires a degree of experimentation with these methods to find the right solution for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

But there are a lot of natural supplements and foods that are said to help with weight loss. I have personally noticed a difference when using these specific foods and supplements in my diet v.s. when I am not. I am not a nutritionist or medical professional by any means.. these are just things that I have tried for myself, along with eating healthy and exercising.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I am a 22 year old female... 5'2"".. and weigh about 112lbs. I have always been small and have never surpassed 120lbs in my life.. but I have fluctuated between about 105 and 116 over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time I have been at my leanest and under 110lbs, I have been...

\- consuming a lot of green tea, at least 2 or 3 glasses a day

\- taking spirulina, about 6 tablets a day or a tablespoon of powder in a smoothie

\- eating a tablespoon of coconut oil a day.. or a bit more. I actually like to make it a bit fun and make a coconut oil based fudge.. there a lot of recipes out there for this.. you really just need coconut oil, raw coco powder, a teeny bit of salt, and a teeny bit of sweetener... I use honey. I thought that this would be too much fat in my diet and the fudge seems kind of indulgent but you really aren't eating much of it at all.. it's about the equivalent of 2 squares of chocolate. I noticed a massive difference in my digestion when I started to eat this everyday. I have IBS and celiac and often times my digestion can get really backed up. Eating coconut oil really helps keep me regular. I don't know if this really has any weight loss properties but keeping your bowels moving can really help flatten down your stomach as it prevents things from backing up and making your belly stick out. Sometimes when I think that I've actually gained a lot of weight it's actually just poop.. to be honest lol.

\- Drinking a lot of water... obviously.. this actually really helps with my skin for the most part. 

\- Drinking espresso.. I never get milk or any sort of syrup in my coffee.. it's not not necessary. I only ever get a ""fun"" coffee on the occasional weekend or day outing.. but absolutely not as a regular thing. I notice better effects when I drink espresso rather than a full cup of black coffee. I usually have one or two espresso shots throughout the day but I always have one before a workout... it definitely helps with my energy and is said to increase your metabolism and the body's ability to burn fat during activity temporarily. 

\- Eating a lot of bananas.... I know.. a lot of sugar.. and I am not Freely the banana girl either.. I do swear. But I do recall that when I'm at my absolute leanest I am usually consuming a decent amount of fruit.. mainly bananas. I like to put 2 bananas in my protein smoothies.. and sometimes I like to have a banana before my workout as well.

\- Eating a LOT of greens. When I am at my leanest and lowest weight.. I am also usually eating a lot of greens at the time. I'll put a very generous fist full of spinach in my protein smoothie... AND have a BIG salad for lunch and dinner. 

\- Eating a lot in general. When I was at my absolute leanest.. I was eating A LOT. Nothing bad though.. all completely clean foods, nothing processed. I never count calories but I do believe that I was probably eating over 2000.

&amp;#x200B;

Again.. all of these things are things that I am doing all together with a daily workout (I hit the gym about 5 to 6 days a week)... and just generally making healthy decisions. The thing is that when I'm JUST eating healthy and going to the gym and NOT taking these supplements.. I do notice that I am not as lean. All of the above are things that brought me to about 106lbs.. which is appropriate for my height but may not be for some.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else noticed that supplements such as spirulina... or taking in a lot of green tea.. or even coconut oil.. has helped control their weight or accelerate their process? Do you think that it's all of these things done together that has given me results? Or is there one specific thing on that list that really stands out to you as something that really works?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone is always looking for the magic pill that will help increase their metabolism, drop fat, stop bloating, give them more energy, etc. But of course such a thing doesn&amp;#39;t truly exist, at least not any that are good for you and don&amp;#39;t cause a whole host of other issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Despite being healthy, I used to have a pretty bad diet. I used to eat candies (mostly milk chocolate) everyday and in quantities that were far from being healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

I was gaining unwanted weight, so I decided to change my diet. While I don't want to completely eliminate sugar, nowadays I only eat it 2 or 3 times per week and smaller portions. The issue is, I am seriously constipated.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a regular milk chocolate consumer, I'd go to the bathroom everyday. Nowadays it's once per week and with a lot of pain and sacrifice. I am also always bloated (which my doctor blames on IBS), and I can tell the bloating is due to the constipation because when I go to the bathroom it becomes a lot better. I wake up on a flat stomach everyday and as soon as I eat, my belly bloats up to the point where people congratulate me on being pregnant (which I'm not!).

&amp;#x200B;

I eat around 4 - 5 portions of fruits and vegetables everyday, one small portion of walnuts (which sometimes give me stomach pains), 3-4 low sugar yogurts, 1 - 3 servings of carbs (toast with eggs for breakfast, then between meals I'll have one or two small cups or cornflakes, sometimes wheat cookies), 3 - 4 coffees, and either 2 servings of fish or 1 fish + 1 meat.

I'm doing Stronglifts 5x5 since last October (1 month break on December and May to August because of traveling).

For those who aren't familiar with Stronglift, it's a strength program using only compound exercice (good for skinny guys who want mass)

I'm 19 years old and 166 lbs and I just moved to my first apartment ever !

My actual form[ looks like this](https://imgur.com/VETPKrc).

Long story short, the last year, my parents weren't home 4 days a week, so I took this opportunity to practice my cooking skill and made myself a recipe book !

With a lot of research and practice, I gained 10 pounds since October and those 4 months of break.

Since I'm used to be eating healthy, may you guys give me any tips for my diet ?

I am fully equip (meal prep's container, steam cooker, microwave, good knife,  a lot of spices, etc..)

Since it will be my first year at the university, I plan to meal prep a lot making big batch of 10-15 dishes.

I'll put the first two days in the refrigerator and the rest in the freezer.

On training, I take BCAA and mass-gainer post-training.

This is what a usually eat

* Morning : pancake : coconut oil + (3 eggs, 50g oath, cinnamon and 1 banana) + green thea
* 2 Snack/day : a handful of nuts / banana (again)  / cranberry / greek yogurt + oat 
* Diner and supper :

\- (200g chicken | 200g broccoli)

\- (200g chicken | 200g sweet potato)

\- (200g chicken |85g Broccoli |100g rice)

\- (150g ground steak | 250g of any veggies \[brocoli/bean/sweet potato\]) 2 times a week for the iron from the cow

I sometime put some greek yogurt and/or avocado in those meals

First, my questions are :

Is three eggs too much in the morning ?

Di I eat too much chicken  ? If yes, is it bad ?

To sum up, I would like your suggestions and some Cheap 'N Good recipes to **help me gain some weight** without having to do the bulk &amp; lean process.

Thanks a lot,

Euf

I’ve been a long time lurker here, r/Keto, and other weight loss related subreddit but never posted myself- Mostly because I never succeeded more than a day or two...

My currently working diet: Eating half of everything.

I eat out often and also eat A LOT. I would continue to eat even if I’m full because food is just too delicious. So instead of restricting food or making “diet meals”, I just cut all my food in half.

I ate out as normally, asked for to-go container and immediately portioned my food in half. I realized how little could fill me. 

Eating less on day 1 made me motivate to move more. I started by walking outside on first day. By day 2 I actually went to the gym and cardio+lifted some weights!

One week has passed and it’s still going!! I did my first weight check and I went from 141lbs to 135.8lbs. Probably lost a lot of water weight but I feel so much happier.

Just wanted to share this diet for those like me

I tried eating more fast food and stuff like that, but it didn't seem to have too much of an effect, I gained weight according to the doctors, but I didn't feel any curves or anything come in.

I'm not sure if it's because my foods are low in fat content, because on the bus trip, and when I was at my dad's place, I wasn't really eating too many meats or eggs (at least for a while), so I'm not sure if that might've been it.

This summer I am not looking as toned as I would have liked.. I've been super toned and defined in the past, active, eating healthy.. etc. It's no different now... the weight only came from a bit more drinking during the spring semester due to stress and also all of my friends turning 21 and honestly it isn't even that much, all I know is that I used to be more toned.

I do have a lot of experience with health and fitness and eating healthy and I've had great results in the past so I just decided to go and search for some new methods. A lot of people are focusing on low carb, no grains, etc... so I started doing it too... I'm a vegetarian and I tend to eat a LOT of fruit.. particularly bananas.. since I'm trying to be a bit lower carb, I've cut back on fruit and added in more veggies.. definitely avoiding grains, and just being healthy.

As for exercise I go for a 2 to 5 mile morning run depending on my time frame and energy level, and I usually go to the gym for an hour session in the evening.

I haven't seen the results that I've wanted though. Last summer I was the fittest and leanest that I had ever been in my life. Abs. Everything. I was doing the same exercise plan.. in fact.. probably running shorter distances in the morning.. more like a quick 1.5 mile jaunt on either nothing or 1 banana. I was also hitting the gym in the afternoon and doing pretty much the same stuff.

So why am I not seeing the results that I want?

The only difference that I can think of is my carb, and particularly.. fruit intake. Last summer I ate a shit ton of fruit. I got leaner and leaner and even to the point where I may have been too skinny?! I saw fast changes in my body and was definitely dropping fat, and keeping muscle at a consistent rate.

I drank a lot of smoothies.. with hemp protein powder. I was also drinking a lot of green tea and taking spirulina in supplement form and powder form in my smoothies. I was also putting 2 bananas in my smoothies.. and probably eating bananas on the side as well! I was eating salad for lunch everyday with beets, goat cheese, spinach or spring mix, sprouts, etc. I was eating tons of chickpeas and quinoa as well, which I would also mix into my salads. Again, I was stocked with fruit,. mango.. strawberries... blueberries... BANANAS... etc. I also ate 1/2 to 1 avocado a day.. again.. in salads.... Oh.. and I even remember one of my favorite treats being coconut oil - caocao fudge that I made!? I would eat a 1x1"" square every day for a dessert or just something to satisfy my cravings. Another breakfast item that I enjoyed was banana pancakes... two bananas.. and egg... some fruit.. honey... cinnamon.. a bit of salt... BAM. YUM. Some protein.. and CARBS AND SUGARRRR.

Calorie wise I was definitely hitting my needs and even possibly going over. I was probably eating a ton of sugar, in fruit form.. and again, a lot of carbs.

The thing is that eating carbs did make me crave more carbs, and now that I'm avoiding carbs and eating more protein and fat I am definitely craving carbs less and not feeling hunger as often.. but I'm also NOT SEEING RESULTS!!!!! I am also positive that I am UNDER my needed calorie intake and again.. no tone.. nothing.. but disappointment.

To be honest I sometimes think that all of those high carb vegan girls who preach eating a lot, eating a lot of fruit, eating frequently, eating a lot of carbs, etc... are just taking the piss and telling people to eat like that to have bodies like them when in turn it could actually do the opposite.. but then.. I think..... **i had a body like theirs.. and I was eating exactly how they preached** (on my own accord.. because it's naturally what I wanted to eat).

SO WTF!? Are any of you guys high carb, clean eaters (maybe vegan, veggie, or just lean meats) and seeing that you are really fucking toned and lean and everything is good in the world? Because that's how I was! Did anyone else here get lean and toned and defined with a low carb diet? Are any of you struggling? Because I genuinely want to know!

I've been experimenting with some weight loss for awhile now, nearly a year ago I was +10lbs and was not enjoying how I looked. Since, I've changed a ton; no candy, many many fewer carbs, next to zero pop, and I've almost entirely stopped drinking. In addition I've cut calories from what might have been around 4000 a day to 2000 a day; the process was slow and I started seeing results, but the time management just wasn't working.

While I was at 2000cal, I was eating a metric ton of vegetables, going strong with chicken, eggs, and many things that are generally accepted as healthy. But again, the time management was horrible and I could not sustain it. I started moving towards Intermittent Fasting, it's great! My time management was getting much better, but now the amount of food I was eating was becoming a striking issue; the calories hadn't changed but the volume of actual food was murder on how I felt throughout the day. But again, I was seeing progress and trying to find better way to do things.

In came some questionable things that I know are in the infant stages of being generally accepted. I've heard a few talking about the carnivore diet. How ever you feel about this realize I was wholly against it when I first heard of it nearly 6 months ago; I said things like ""NO! You can't just eat meat!"", ""Where are you getting all these nutrients!?"", ""You're insane!!"". Well, it kept coming up, I kept seeing it, and I kept reading and struggling with my  current plan and successes.

I watched Jordan B Peterson talk about it on the Joe Rogan podcast and it was just the straw that broke the camel's back. I know he is not a doctor of the kind, he states it loudly and is incredibly forward about it during the podcast, but I also see him as an honest person opposed to the others I had heard about this from because I simply didn't know who they were. His words were the same as the others and I simply trust him.

So I tried it. I started planning, I started adding up the macros and calories, it all made sense. I was still eating some vegetables, I was not willing to commit to this in some psychotic manner, I knew I had to make some concessions and keep some vegetables.

WOW! I felt great! The increase in beef in my diet meant I didn't have to eat nearly the volume I was and I could still make my calories; I was not only able to push my diet into a better eating window, but I was shrinking it to 4 hours without really noticing. I had pushed carbs down to \~10% a day which was impossible with what I was doing, and I was eating MORE calories and losing MORE weight. I was up to 2600ish a day. My macros were looking like 35% Protein, 10% carbs, and 55% fats. I was suddenly plummeting and feeling really good while doing it.

My lowest weight was 215lbs less than a week ago; you'll note at the top what my current weight is. I've been sick for a few days, feels like a truck hit me. This is the second time I've come to this on this diet and I don't understand. I use MyFitnessPal and still track even my micro nutrients and they all seem to line up, nothing is obnoxiously over, nothing is obnoxiously under. I'm pretty certain it has to do with what I'm eating, but at the same time... I don't know. What's the difference between getting all my vitamins and minerals from one source vs another? Additionally, this diet has been working amazingly well with my time, capacity to eat, and I'm eating MORE calories.

I'm just not sure what to do. The thing that's working for me seems to be working me into a corner and putting me on my ass. Additionally, for as good as I feel on this path, I don't think it's healthy to lose weight as fast as I did and I think that's a major contributor.

I'm at a point where I usually work out 1 hour per day, mosty dumbbell lifting and other no-equipment-needed exercises (e.g. leg lifting, lunges, squats, stuff to shape problematic areas i.e. EVERYWHERE). I've been doing this for 2 months.

It kind of seems to work (I can wear my few sizes smaller jeans now and my old jeans are too big) but the progress is really slow. Like, painfully slow. I'm really short (ca. 161 cm) and horribly fat; my ideal weight should be around 50 kg, I'm twice as much for sure. Somewhere I read about the recommended calorie intake for this weight, I could never eat that much (2000 or so cal per day). That's just ridiculous!

I'm too scared to measure my weight or my waist or anything related to numbers that could show the progress that can't really be seen yet. I want to speed the whole thing up with more daily workout and a rather drastic diet change. I'm sick of myself not being able to wear normal clothes and just being freaking ugly all the time.

So that's why if any of you know any good diets that could help with quicker weight loss please let me know, I would be super grateful. I know the healthiest way would be this slooow lifestyle change, I will do that too once I look acceptable.

As for working out more I did play Just Dance from time to time. I stopped that a while ago because I can't stop thinking how ugly I must look jumping around trying to mimic all those pretty dancers. I really liked it but I'm way too ugly to enjoy that. :(

I also plan to go to the gym but first I want to build up some fitness at home, lose quite a bit of weight as well as look less like a monster when I go to a place where other people can see me. I'm just terrified at the thought of gym people seeing a whale me exercising.

So here’s my body info:

Male
Height: 6’3”
Weight: around 245lbs
Age: 24
Percent body fat: I have no idea, around 23%? I’m a lean guy just looking at me with clothes on, but’m when my belly bulges and man boobs show through my shirt, I do NOT feel lean lolol.

Eating habits: I typically get a first meal between 10am- 11am on weekdays with a bedtime of around 10pm-11pm. Portion control is an issue for me- being a large dude, I’ve alway rationalized more portions with my size “needing it” but I think I simply eat too much as well. My weakness is sweets (baked goods, ice cream) and snacking, especially before bed. I’ve had discipline in the past, so I have at least “Been there” experiencing a disciplined lifestyle- just no consistency and is not currently present.

Health: I have always been very healthy in terms of no diseases and no health concerns besides some sports induced asthma. My mental health is another question, I can be compulsive and can get into mental holes.

Activity level: active stretching everyday, moderate movement and workouts every other day to every two days. Good amount of strength and flexibility.

I’ve played sports all my life. I’ve always had a belly all my life. I have never been able to look straight down towards my feet and NOT see belly rolls. Sound superficial? In a way it is. In another it’s pure anger and years of defeat on the subject. 

I’m simply sick and tired of my fat slowing me down. I feel like I’m carrying around the same fat from when I was a preteen and it’s still hanging from my midsection. I feel like I’ve read too many articles, opinions, books, trying to find an objective solution to my subjective problem. 

Would anyone recommend some diet plan for me based on my body’s specs ?


","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello! 
So here’s my body info:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male
Height: 6’3”
Weight: around 245lbs
Age: 24
Percent body fat: I have no idea, around 23%? I’m a lean guy just looking at me with clothes on, but’m when my belly bulges and man boobs show through my shirt, I do NOT feel lean lolol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating habits: I typically get a first meal between 10am- 11am on weekdays with a bedtime of around 10pm-11pm. Portion control is an issue for me- being a large dude, I’ve alway rationalized more portions with my size “needing it” but I think I simply eat too much as well. My weakness is sweets (baked goods, ice cream) and snacking, especially before bed. I’ve had discipline in the past, so I have at least “Been there” experiencing a disciplined lifestyle- just no consistency and is not currently present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health: I have always been very healthy in terms of no diseases and no health concerns besides some sports induced asthma. My mental health is another question, I can be compulsive and can get into mental holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity level: active stretching everyday, moderate movement and workouts every other day to every two days. Good amount of strength and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

I struggled for years with body image and went through bouts of both anorexia and bulemia while younger. Lots of therapy later, I'm doing much better, but am still an emotional/stress eater, and have seen the numbers on the scale slowly creep upwards. In dieting in the past, even while not actively engaged in ""disordered"" behavior, I struggle to find a happy medium of not over-controlling what I'm putting in my body, becoming obsessive, and slipping back into bad mental habits. 

Meanwhile, the numbers on the scale have slowly crept up and up and up, and this week my doctor asked me to try to lose weight. Notably, she said I could lose up to 50 pounds and be within a healthy BMI. She would like me to lose at least 25 pounds. 

I travel a lot for work, several weeks of the month, so can't prepare a lot of my own food, which I think doesn't help. One friend said to just stop ordering anything I enjoy so I won't want to eat it, which is the most depressing advice anyone has ever given me.

I guess I'm curious what has worked for others who have a history of eating disorders.

- brown rice (5/15 meals) or brown pasta (2/15 meals).

I'm going to get myself re-tested in a few weeks time but in the meantime I need to know some healthy alternatives to brown rice. I've tried Google but I couldn't get a decent answer.

People going through something terrible can feel just a little better knowing they aren't alone. 

So here I am. I'm not going to get too personal other than to say I'm at an unhealthy weight and have been my whole life. I had VSG a few years back and it worked for a year, then I gained it back over the next 5. 

I hadn't planned on dieting this go round; it just kind of happened. One of the things I learned from so many failed attempts, is that I can't do half measures. Call it a personality flaw but I'm either all in, or I can't hack it. 

So I stopped caring, stopped worrying about details, and started by fasting. I'm not folllowing any diets and I'm not calorie counting. This is really simple for me to follow. I don't eat unless I need to. For me, that is about 2 cheese sticks and a salad every 24-36 hours. That's a starbucks and juice in the morning, and unsweeteened ice tea the rest of the day. 

It's working for me longer and better than anything I have tried, including surgery. I don't have any bad cravings, my needs aren't trying to sabotage me. I feel I could do this the rest of my life. I've never been an over eater, and after surgery couldn't physically overeat if I tried. Yet I plateaued and then gained. 

Instead of worrying how much dieting was safe, I decided to eat the bare minimum to keep my heart and muscles healthy, to eat good food instead of processed crud, and to go easy on myself. 

I'll be down 30lbs by this weekend, almost exactly a month after I started. I feel 10 years younger, I've had to get new clothes once already, and I have more shopping to look forward to next month. 

Please don't starve yourself. We are all different and what I'm doing is easily unhealthy, and it would probably backfire on you. But know that even a hopeless case like me, can sometimes get control over their health, and make a positive change. It sucks, you can endure it, and you will thank yourself because it's so worth it. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things i learned going through a divorce, is that it helps to have people to lean on, and it feels really good to let others lean on you too. People going through something terrible can feel just a little better knowing they aren&amp;#39;t alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am. I&amp;#39;m not going to get too personal other than to say I&amp;#39;m at an unhealthy weight and have been my whole life. I had VSG a few years back and it worked for a year, then I gained it back over the next 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t planned on dieting this go round; it just kind of happened. One of the things I learned from so many failed attempts, is that I can&amp;#39;t do half measures. Call it a personality flaw but I&amp;#39;m either all in, or I can&amp;#39;t hack it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I stopped caring, stopped worrying about details, and started by fasting. I&amp;#39;m not folllowing any diets and I&amp;#39;m not calorie counting. This is really simple for me to follow. I don&amp;#39;t eat unless I need to. For me, that is about 2 cheese sticks and a salad every 24-36 hours. That&amp;#39;s a starbucks and juice in the morning, and unsweeteened ice tea the rest of the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s working for me longer and better than anything I have tried, including surgery. I don&amp;#39;t have any bad cravings, my needs aren&amp;#39;t trying to sabotage me. I feel I could do this the rest of my life. I&amp;#39;ve never been an over eater, and after surgery couldn&amp;#39;t physically overeat if I tried. Yet I plateaued and then gained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of worrying how much dieting was safe, I decided to eat the bare minimum to keep my heart and muscles healthy, to eat good food instead of processed crud, and to go easy on myself. &lt;/p&gt;

Should I eat on the healthier side with like veggies, juices, smoothies and all that or try to eat as much as I can (not like donuts and pizza etc)  like protein bagels, peanut butter, burritos from chipotle, avocado, nuts etc. I don’t know if I’m making any sense I obviously have NO idea what I’m talking about but hopefully you get the point?? Do I take in less or more calories?

Also, I do have a pretty bad eating habit. I’ll eat like once a day or maybe have a snack or two (super unhealthy I know!!) And I’m a vegetarian too so any advice would help (and NO I’m not going to eat meat please don’t suggest that, thank you).

I have been now 12 weeks on a keto diet and lost over 15kg which feels incredible, first the keto diet seemed hard and i was starving but when i got myself into ketosis i felt great! better than ever before actually,
I have even gotten some friends to try it out and they have had success with it, I would recommend this diet to anyone who is looking to lose weight or live more healthy life style.

Here is some general information for you about keto diet if you're not familiar how it works:

**WHY KETO WORKS!**
Ketosis is the state where your body is actually burning fat for energy instead of carbs. Ketosis is extremely hard to obtain on your own and takes weeks to accomplish but there are some tricks to get into ketosis faster.

**The Solution:**

1. When your body is in ketosis, you are actually burning stored fat for energy and not carbs!

2. Fat IS the body’s ideal source of energy and when you are in ketosis you experience energy and mental clarity like never before and of course very rapid weight loss. 

Ketosis is huge topic to dive in and learn all kinds of tricks I recommend checking out A ketogenic diet for beginners guide by dietdoctor which you can find [HERE](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/keto)
and also if you want to speed up the process me and my friends have been using this to enchance the fat loss effect you can find the product im talking about [HERE](http://www.ketogenickickstart.info)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been now 12 weeks on a keto diet and lost over 15kg which feels incredible, first the keto diet seemed hard and i was starving but when i got myself into ketosis i felt great! better than ever before actually,

I write this as I’m slightly concerned and bemused by what’s happening with me.
 
So since around March time I started back on slimming world, this started well for a couple of weeks but then slowed down, then led to weight gain. After a good few weeks of gaining nearly half a stone even though I was sticking to the diet I decided it was time to try something new. 

I turned to the 5:2 diet, intermittent fasting had worked for me before so I thought sod it I’ll try again. However this hasn’t worked since I put the half a stone on ive pretty much maintained and not lost anything or if I have it’s then gone back on the following week. 

Now in terms of exercise I will do the following in a regular week:-
2x swimming
1x hiit session
I try get out from work every day for an half hour walk. Sometimes I’ll take the long walk as well on an evening to get the car. So in total I can end up doing around 3 Miles a day. 

I’ve occasionally done weights but this will be twice a month tops. 

I’m getting really disheartened with this. I’m pretty much following the same regime as my mate and he’s losing lbs after lbs week in week out and I’m happy for him but I can’t work out where I’m going wrong. 

Weekends will sometimes lead to the odd bad meal, not a bad day just one meal where I’m not strict on a Friday evening and a Saturday evening. But the rest of those days are good clean days. 

Can anyone offer any assistance or advice or anything to start losing this weight?

I've never been great at keeping up a consistent diet plan to work in sync with my exercise. In the past 6 months I've definitely put on weight / got fatter in the said areas due to soft drinks / chocolate / fast food consumption.

Since being given the all clear, I'm now starting to exercise + weight train again.

Now I don't seem to lose any weight or it fluctuates from day to day alot. I think it's because of my diet or the amount that I eat. I am a student so often eat easy to make food like macaroni, rice, fries one time a week on friday, instant soup and selfmade pancakes and alot of chicken with stickbread.

 I am looking for a structured diet that is basically a schedule for each day what to eat and what time so i know what to buy when to eat what and can prepare I like structure. Now I don't have money to pay a dietricion cause since i'm a student living on my own i already struggle with money.
So wondered if any of you have any helpful websites can have a diet like that or someone here can provide it for me It would help a lot.

Diets vary alot depending on howmuch you weigh and how tall you are right? so here's some info about me : 21 years old, about 1.78m tall, 109 kilograms. My aim is to lose about 20 kilos.

The thing that i find the weirdest is the fluctuation in my weight like i weigh myself every morning and if i eat macaroni for example i gain 600 grams next day i lose 400 is this normal?

Also would you suggest running outside over my work-outs? Not sure what is better to burning calories. My condition and sustain has improved alot i've been doing execises now for about a month.

I feel like i've written way to much here but i'd like to talk to someone about this and what is the best approach for this.

So today, I just felt really tired and lazy after coming back home in the evening and I ended up skipping the gym altogether. Now I feel really guilty for skipping. 

How do you keep yourself motivated to continue to exercise when you're not seeing immediate results? I know I have to be patient if I want long\-term results, but it's hard to keep my spirits up.

I've been working on trying to eat much healthier and exercise more and I've seen some results. I'm 5'7 and I'm trying to go from 165 to 145 and I'm already halfway there! One of the major things I'm trying to work on right now is cutting out red meat, not just for the weight loss but also for the positive effects on my digestion and the lowering of carcinogens in my body. 

Every morning I go to Santiago's for dinner (I work overnights). Last week I was eating the carnitas burrito with spicy green chilli (Because capcaisin is good for you!) but I cut this out and replaced it with a bean and cheese burrito. While I was ordering this morning someone suggested that cheese has a lot of fat in it and that I should get the chicken and rice burrito, I replied that rice has a lot of carbohydrates and I wasn't sure if it was really healthier. I tried to look up nutritional facts for these burritos but I came up short. I am wondering which is healthier:

my burrito which consists of bean puree and a sprinkling of cheese

a burrito which consists of bits of chicken and about 1/2 cup rice

Both contain equal parts green chilles on a flour tortilla.

Hi, everyone! Brand new to this sub, but I could really use some advice. 

A little about me: Female, mixed-race Irish and Japanese (this does affect what I eat), age 33, 5'9""/175cm tall, 185lbs/83.9kg. A year ago, I weighed 240lbs/108.9kg, but lost a bunch. My natural weight is around 130-140lbs, but due to a chronic and life-threatening medical condition, I was forced to take meds that made me gain 100lbs. Better fat than dead, right? I can't seem to drop below 185, though, no matter how much I train (I'm a competitive martial artist). But that's only my secondary issue.

Last night, in the ER, I was diagnosed with severe gastritis, and was told that if I don't change my eating habits, I'm risking permanent damage to my stomach and pancreas. Obviously, not good; would like to avoid. I'll be the first to admit I eat like crap. Diet soda, red meat, high-fat foods, tempura and other fried foods, super spicy foods... It's amazing I lost as much weight as I have.

So, I was hoping that someone here might have some ideas on how I can make some changes (baby steps, please lol) to help control my gastritis and avoid permanent damage. I was thinking maybe stuck to the Japanese food, and just avoid the fried dishes? (Goodbye takoyaki 😭)

Its been about 4 months now and I don&amp;#39;t miss it at all. In the meantime I&amp;#39;ve also cut out pork, which made no impact on my life one way or the other. I&amp;#39;ve been eating more turkey, chicken, and fish, as well as increasing my vegetables and vegetable proteins. Even though I haven&amp;#39;t noticed any changes in my appearance, I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; better, and to me that&amp;#39;s more important at this time. What I&amp;#39;m wondering though, is if I should just go full vegetarian? I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s going to keep making me feel even better. My family has always eaten a very meat heavy diet, we&amp;#39;re very Midwestern, which means family gatherings are very meat-centric, and I know if I continue to eat bird meat then at least there will be something there I CAN eat. So, I guess the toss up is, stop eating meat completely and hope the diet benefits will help me but not have a lot I can eat at family gatherings, OR keep eating bird meat for the convenience of the rest of the people in my family?&lt;/p&gt;

First I'm going to start with explaining what I am eating currently for most meals.

Due to this I have started drinking the Chobani Drinks in order to help sustain myself until lunch (I wake up at 5am, drive 40 mins to get to work at 6am, and then don't have lunch until 12). As for lunch I have started to bring in pre-made salads from grocery stores just for the simplicity of it. As for dinner I generally like to be able to make something easy due to the fact that I've had such a long day at work (most days i don't get off until 5-6pm) The only bad part about this is that easy to make dinners are generally not the most healthy thing.

I would really appreciate some advice for some other ideas of things to do for breakfast/lunch and maybe some easy ideas for dinners. I don't mind doing some prep for my meals the day before and the biggest issue with dinners is that I generally eat dinners with my Fiance and she does not like vegetables.

I'm starting to get frustrated because my weight keeps fluctuating on the scale. My lowest was last friday, at 195. I went out that night but I was at a super low deficit (around 700 calories) because I ran earlier and did lifting. I had a cheat meal sat and sunday cuz of easter. The foods were high in sodium, but were under my caloric intake. I weighed myself yesterday nd today and I was at 199 again. Although its weird because clothes i couldnt fit into at 200, I fit into now. I don't drink every night at all. I stay on my diet throughout the week and only go out fridays with friends. 

I drink Vodka with no cal sparkling flavor waters., so I'm not just pounding beers. I'll have 2-3 double shots in one of the 24 oz waters and drink water throughout the night. I am wondering if it is just water retention. I drink almost a gallon of water everyday in the week and about half a gallon during the weekend. 

My fat per day is very low. My actual calories I am supposed to eat is around 2k, however I eat a little lower because some days at work I'm not walking around as much as other days. I'm not sure if this is having a negative affect on my lost journey. I know never to eat below 1200. I also have a habit of not eating calories back that I burned running or working out. Not sure if that is harmful.

I guess my main question is; why my weight fluctuates so much and if im fucking up or its probably just water retention. Since I'm still able to fit into clothes I couldn't fit into at 200lbs.

About a year ago I stumbled upon this ""article"": https://github.com/arielf/weight-loss

In it, the author explains how he got overweighted after moving to the states and decided to change it. He started to keep track of all the food he ate - not even the amount nor calories, just the type -, the things he did and weighted himself every day.

Using data analysis, he then processed how much of an impact each of these things had on his weight.

I found this process amazing and inspiring, so I decided to make an app to allow everyone to do the same: https://app.getdailys.com/

Because of the nature of the app, it's not limited to diet though. You can track and compare absolutely anything :p.

Now obviously I’m not going to restrict myself to just tuna. I’m going to eat veggies and salads with it, but I wanted to know if his would be a good diet. I dance and workout almost every day. I’m mainly concerned on my caloric intake. My view on this is that if I burn more calories then I take in I’ll lose weight. That’s a no brainer, but how much should I be eating?  The can of tuna I buy is 60 calories and has 15g of protein. The salads I eat are spinach, bacon, cheese, and cranberries. As for a treat I eat rice cakes with a tbsp of peanut butter which is 160 calories. I’ve gone through lots of ideas on what exactly to eat, but I never know what is best for me. &lt;/p&gt;
