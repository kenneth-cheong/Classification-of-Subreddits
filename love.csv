Great and vast, it separates us

Yet here I stand, awaiting you

Contact 

Directly from the eyes, it speaks 

Of things unspoken, of things anew

Darkness

Nonexistent in your presence 

But when you're gone, it swallows me 

Comfort

I receive, just by looking at you 

Gazing upon perfection as it was meant to be 


How I long to be your significant other 

How I long to speak my mind 

How I long to gaze into your beautiful eyes 

And leave the past behind 

How I wish to caress your silky hair

How I wish to hold your hand 

How I wish to sweep you off your feet

How I want to be your man 


Alas

For now, it cannot be

By an invisible wall I am barred 

Freedom

I see it within my grasp 

But obtaining it seems all too hard 


I think of all the years I've spent 

Pining after you 

I remember all the times I've known

That I dearly love you true

I count the days until I see you next 

To fill my life with sunshine

I wait for the opportunity to come

To talk to you, to become your friend

Still I wait, wait for that time


Time 

I'll love you until the end of time 

One 

You are The One, I know you are 

Love 

To hug, to kiss, to cuddle, to love 

But 

Still...I'm doomed to worship you from afar.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance &lt;/p&gt;

Me,I,etc : me obviusly 
COUSIN: BEST DUDE!!!

I am on mobile so sorry for the weird format , also emglish is my 3rd language so yea...

Backstory : I am 17 turning 18 now and SA is also the same. 

Me and SA had known each other for all our lives and were great friends but only met at some family events (they are family friends) so we would meet like a year or 2 later
 and 5 years ago when they visited after A VERY long time , I fell head over heels but since our country and culture doesnt involve dating (YES, THOSE) I only told my aunt since she is very open minded ,she told me to be patient and this may be a petty crush...but no 
when I went home that day and remembered I wouldnt see SA for maybe a year or two I cried and cried ,life was hell ,every living moment my mind went to her and I became medically depressed in months 
A year later I met my best friend online (potatoe) ,we were both depressed but made each other happy so we started dating long distance for a few months (in secret)  . We realized we just wanted to be best friends (still are) and broke up , then another year passes by and its finally here , another family event . 
At the event as soon as I saw SA (i know its cheesy) my head spun and I felt heavy ,I knew I had to tell her how I felt so a day later I told her about everything and she (to my surprise ) shared the same feelings for me .
After the event I thought I would be ok since I finally let my feelings out...oooooohhhh no...I felt weak,insignificent and powerless ,every moment I thought ""what if SA is engaged to someone before I can do anything?(YES THIS SICK STUFF HAPPENS HERE I HATE IT) ,what if she doesnt really like me back? ,etc "" with those thoughts and study stress and other problems all of It threw me into another cycle of depression even worse and I started self harm and the only thing keeping me from suicide was SA .
Fast forward to 3 months back (three years later) and its my cousins wedding ,everyone was coming (including them) so I was obvoiusly there ,I was helping around and then in the corner of my vision our eyes met ,SA went instantly blazen red and I just ran away (because not a lot of people here have experience in things like a romatic partner) . Once I was calm enough I aproached her (trying to not let anyone know what my motive was) we shake hands (normal greeting here) and start talking ,we both are stuttering and trying to find words and after a few minutes i had to go .
 SA wanted to see how much I liked her so she told a very close friend and cousin of mine that she would start crying and see what I would do when she said that my cousin was the one responsible .(it was a very cruel prank)
I come in and find  SA in a corner crying ,I quickly leave all I was doing and approach her and put my hand on her shoulder (considered bold move here) 
Me : what happened?!

SA : COUSIN is hitting on me and said if I say anything he will tell our parents.

Me *Red with anger* :YOU MOTHERF*#%ER!!!
 *running to my cousin*

COUSIN : Wait wait wait!!!

I ended up punching him before he could explain but I apologized and it was all ok .
SA then dragged me to somewhere quite and we talked for 2 hours about how much we missed each other and all that . 
When they had to leave it was so heartbreaking to see her go without even being able to wave bye. 
Fast forward a month 2 days before my twin siblings birthday and her mom calls my mom saying that SA wanted to greet my twin siblings happy birthday (they are much younger then us ) and from this we got the excuse to talk on phone SA told me to call her mom's number whenever I got a message from it so we could talk more .(she doesnt have a phone)

I am typing this cause I met SA again today ,only for a while but it was still nice ,we are always trying to figure out a way to make our families recognize our love and engage us or ANYTHING REALLY AT THIS POINT!! 

I will keep updating this story as our relationship (hopefully) keeps growing ,its very hard but we know we love each other and will always will.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;SA: the girl I love

Fast forward to 3 months back (three years later) and its my cousins wedding ,everyone was coming (including them) so I was obvoiusly there ,I was helping around and then in the corner of my vision our eyes met ,SA went instantly blazen red and I just ran away (because not a lot of people here have experience in things like a romatic partner) . Once I was calm enough I aproached her (trying to not let anyone know what my motive was) we shake hands (normal greeting here) and start talking ,we both are stuttering and trying to find words and after a few minutes i had to go .
 SA wanted to see how much I liked her so she told a very close friend and cousin of mine that she would start crying and see what I would do when she said that my cousin was the one responsible .(it was a very cruel prank)
I come in and find  SA in a corner crying ,I quickly leave all I was doing and approach her and put my hand on her shoulder (considered bold move here) 
Me : what happened?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SA : COUSIN is hitting on me and said if I say anything he will tell our parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me &lt;em&gt;Red with anger&lt;/em&gt; :YOU MOTHERF&lt;em&gt;#%ER!!!
 *running to my cousin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COUSIN : Wait wait wait!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up punching him before he could explain but I apologized and it was all ok .
SA then dragged me to somewhere quite and we talked for 2 hours about how much we missed each other and all that . 
When they had to leave it was so heartbreaking to see her go without even being able to wave bye. 
Fast forward a month 2 days before my twin siblings birthday and her mom calls my mom saying that SA wanted to greet my twin siblings happy birthday (they are much younger then us ) and from this we got the excuse to talk on phone SA told me to call her mom&amp;#39;s number whenever I got a message from it so we could talk more .(she doesnt have a phone)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am typing this cause I met SA again today ,only for a while but it was still nice ,we are always trying to figure out a way to make our families recognize our love and engage us or ANYTHING REALLY AT THIS POINT!! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep updating this story as our relationship (hopefully) keeps growing ,its very hard but we know we love each other and will always will.&lt;/p&gt;

Crushed hard on a classmate and asked him out. The date was terrible but we remained friends. As time went by we became extremely close, but my feelings for him never went away.

He rejected me, I thought I had my feelings in check (oh the naive 25 year-old me)...We end up moving in together as roommates plus a third friend. And the chemistry just skyrocketed from there. Honestly, I’ve never had the level of intimacy and synchronicity like this with any partner. And he recognized that chemistry, but albeit always joking about how we acted like a married couple, he would say that he thought we’d be a terrible real couple.

The flirting carries on, the almost kiss “moments”, the staying up all night talking...him starring at me whenever I’d play the guitar for him...I could see the longing in his eyes way too often...all of this tension for three years...and then one night at a party...after many many drinks...I kissed him. And he kissed me back with a huge smile on his face. And that was that. We talked the next day, and he said he didn’t think us being together was a good idea. Which just blew my mind, everyone around us could see the romantic tension in between us and comment on it, and none wouldn’t understand his motive. I just learned to stop trying to figure the why.

A week later his best friend, unbeknownst to me, kissed me and asked me to be with him, even knowing about my feelings for the other guy. I said yes, and my friend just went crazy. He didn’t speak to me properly for a couple of months

Time passed, I moved out, I broke up with the love interests friend, friendship went back to normal with love interest. I got over him. He found a steady girlfriend, with whom he’s living with now. It’s been 3 years.

After all that time we finally hangout without her, just us two and the third ex-roommate...and man how I missed him. The him he is without her. He’s never him around her. So he then confessed to us that they’ve been speaking about breaking up because they can’t seem to overcome their issues. We have him advice, but he seemed unsure. No problem there....but little did I know what was to come.

It’s been a week now, and didn’t think much of it...but that thought of them breaking up, as guilty as I feel, kinda out me in a good mood...then I watched this cheesy Netflix movie of two best friends crushing on each other in their youth, it not working out, and them finding each other again as adults...and that was when I realize that my feelings for my friend has started to flourish all over again. And believe me...I’m not happy about it, I thought I had overcome this, but it’s alive and kicking. 

I need advice on how to hit my emotions with logic, because logically yeah, maybe he’s right and we’re no good together. And he’s in a relationship. And going down that road from back in 2011 all over again is just being a masochist.

Maybe it’s because I haven’t found  the connection we have in any other man. Maybe it’s just because I’ve been single for too long, and I’m also grieving (lost my mom in December), so I’m in need of comfort. I just have no idea why the resurgence and am analyzing the hell of myself to get this feeling gone with.

Sorry this ended up being longer than expected. But I just don’t know who to turn to since my friends are already mad at this “flashback platonic love”, and they can’t even hear about it.

** Feel free to share your thoughts **

I fell in love with this girl in my college. Let's call her S. She has become a very good friend of mine. We have a friend group of four guys and three girls. Our friendship is very mature. It's like a family. We share our happiness, sadness, excitement, problems together. We always help eachother. Now two guys and two girls are already couples. I, S and another boy are single.

There's a twist here. I'm friends with S for over two years. She fell in love with a guy outside our friend circle. That guy committed suicide In March 2018 for his own family reasons. That's when she told me everything about their relationship and stuff. Still nobody knows this besides me.

Now I realised that I'm in love with her around January 2018 but I didn't tell her right away. After that suicide incident she became very depressed and sad. My problem is I can't see my friends sad at all. So I tried to console her for days, took her to eat ice cream. (This girl's first love is ice cream. She can kill you for that😄) I don't know what it was but she realised something about me always being there for her, cheering her up and etc. (Though I do that everytime). One day she straight up asked me ""Do you love me? Don't lie to me. Tell me."" Aaaand I basically said Yes. She became silent and that scared the hell out of me. Then she said, ""Why didn't you tell me before? If I knew I'll never consider anybody else."" Then she started crying again. At that moment I felt like an asshole. After some time she told me that I'll always be in her thoughts but right now she needs some time which pretty self-explanatory and understandable. Then she became really afraid that her rejection might end our friendship. She basically started begging me to understand her feelings and be that same person which I'm. I assured her everything and told her that I'll wait for her. She started getting better eventually. She started talking differently than a normal girl-friend, started holding hand, started to call and text everyday but hasn't told me that she loves me. I brought up that topic once and she said she needs some more time.


Fast forward to June 2019

Our friendship is same as it was before. Still nobody knows anything about her past relationship, tension between us. The other single guy has a girlfriend now and she is in our circle too. The other day I heard some of my friends are gossiping about S's new boyfriend. Yesterday I saw her with this guy. Hanging around in the cafe, chatting, smiling. Friends in our group has no connection with him although we are very friendly with others outside our friend circle. Now my brain is messed up.

Crippled, stifled and silent still, alone, back pierced by jagged hill.

Eternal invisible tears, like a river shaped by fears.  
Endless night in my eyes, sudden delight to my surprise.

Angst and anger wane, a quick and sudden release from pain-

A small reminder of innocence what was, a moment to give my brain pause.  
As you take form within my gaze, I'm reminded of simpler, softer days.

Lifted like a cloud of TV static, my head no longer feeling erratic. 

Tide and tide again your ocean of warmth envelops my hell, breaking, ebbing at my worn and torn shell.

And from the life so carelessly led, I begin to embrace what I had fled,

A feeling of belonging so quintessentially, lasting inner peace mentally. 

When worlds so chaotic break down my door, your presence makes me whole and more.

And even though you you are unaware, of my piercing gaze, my enchanted stare,

In my truest heart of hearts, my love is there.

Deeper than the planet's core, my passion screams ""Amore!""

And what cruelty the world may dare, I will always be right there.

I will hold you up when spirits are high, and lend a shoulder when you're poised to cry.

I will always be honest and true, and if so be it- move mountains for you.

Bullet, Blade or explosive true, I will not hesitate to take any in lieu.

You may not know how strong i feel or that I feel at all, But I will always come to your beck and call.

You may never know my truest love. But for you, you come first- all else and above. 

I am your admirer, your friend and companion with loyalty fierce.

For I remain with my heart, that you pierce.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold, inane and crawling, wandering hands,&lt;br/&gt;

So last night I was feeling emotional and sentimental and started talking about our relationship. All the positives and things I like, finding out what he likes and generally bonding more. I asked him what he would consider to be ""our"" song and he said he hadn't really thought about it, so I asked if there was one or a few that reminded him of me. He pulled up YouTube and queued up a few songs. As we listened, he kept thinking of more and adding them to the queue. I added some choices of my own and we just lied there holding each other and letting these songs wash over us. I've never felt so loved or cherished before.

We started out super casual, just keeping each other company through divorce (both of us were going through divorce when we met) and never expected to fall in love or have a baby or move in together. Yet here we are with all of that and still no anniversary date or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last night I was feeling emotional and sentimental and started talking about our relationship. All the positives and things I like, finding out what he likes and generally bonding more. I asked him what he would consider to be &amp;quot;our&amp;quot; song and he said he hadn&amp;#39;t really thought about it, so I asked if there was one or a few that reminded him of me. He pulled up YouTube and queued up a few songs. As we listened, he kept thinking of more and adding them to the queue. I added some choices of my own and we just lied there holding each other and letting these songs wash over us. I&amp;#39;ve never felt so loved or cherished before. Lying there in the dark in his arms as tears ran down my face out of the pure, raw emotion. There was no need to say anything. The music said it all.&lt;/p&gt;

Every morning we wake up to a kiss and a cuddle

and maybe even some passionate morning sex

We start the day off by being so close in each others arms

Even if its quick because we woke up a little late.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday we  begin the day with such love.

Everyday we begin the day feeling special

We start off the day knowing we are truly loved,

With a smile and a big spring in our step.

&amp;#x200B;

We grab our coffee and go about our day,

working, events, childcare, etc…....

We go about the day always thinking of each other 

sending the odd “I love you” “I miss you” texts throughout the day.

&amp;#x200B;

We are hopeless, We are in love 

And nothing can get in the way

Nothing could distract us 

Or turn our heads away.

&amp;#x200B;

We both feel so safe and secure,

We both are sure that we are truly loved

We have each other back

Through the good days and bad.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of a hard day at work

We come home to a love like no other

There to offer a warm hug and great encouragement

As we put our day aside to enjoy our evenings together.

&amp;#x200B;

We enjoy our evenings together as we are on this crazy adventure

We make each day count as we are never promised another

We walk on the beach and dance under the stars

We make beautiful love through everything we do.

&amp;#x200B;

We lay on the sofa to watch a good movie

As we unwind from a hectic day

We take in a deep breath as a sigh of relief

That we are home with our true love feeling so safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Our life is a wonderful adventure

More love than we have ever known

We feel like we can do anything

As we make each other our king and queen.

&amp;#x200B;

We just love being together

And being each other very best friend

We love traveling, going to concerts, doing life together

And living a life true adventure.

&amp;#x200B;

Our love is very special and can never be questioned 

The love that we have can never be tainted

It wouldn't matter if a true beauty queen or a hunk came along

We'd no that's just surface and not worth a second look.

&amp;#x200B;

We are so perfect for each other

That we cherish our love

We treat each other amazingly

the romance and love will never die!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every morning we wake up to a kiss and a cuddle&lt;/p&gt;

He felt the surge of testosterone speed crazily through his veins. Originally anger energy, now transforming into sexual energy, all combined to inhibit rational thought from his brain. He could not comprehend what was going on. He just acted. It was as if his brain stopped working.

“Nathan. It’s me, Anwa,” she breathed, her voice raspy and heavy.

His eyes glowed in the firelight. He immediately kissed her roughly, meshing his lips into hers. His penis hardened instantly. He ground his hard groin against her tummy, while he pushed his urgent tongue inside of her mouth. 

She groaned. “Mmm, Nath,” she breathed.

His whole body was on fire. Testosterone lit up his nerves, his veins, his groin and overtook his brain. He felt slightly light headed and animalistic, as he clawed at her clothes.

She groaned deeply. Anwa opened her mouth to his, biting his bottom lip.

Shards of electricity shot through his body, as he felt the pain in his lip, but it only spurred his efforts on. He pulled back and looked into her wild eyes. She stared back at him, with a yearning so strong that it hit him in the head like a sledgehammer.

She was breathing roughly now, groaning and her eyes were half closed.

Nath grabbed at her shirt, clawing at it until he exposed her breasts. He marvelled at their magnificence, briefly. Then he immediately sucked on the right nipple, pulling it all into his mouth. She squirmed, pushing her breast into his face, murmured something in her native language and groaned.

He gripped the left breast and squeezed it, the plumpness of it barely fitting in his hand. He had never seen such breasts before. He sucked on the left nipple, then alternated back to the right. Anwa was squirming and groaning, beyond intelligible words, only murmurs and groans escaped from her mouth. The cold air blew over her bare chest, raising her hard nipples even further. Nath covered his head with his fur coat to keep her warm while he worshipped her ample breasts.

Anwa yelped with desire as Nath massaged and sucked her breasts. She had never experienced any such pleasure before. It washed over her and took all her resistance away completely. She was his woman in this moment. She knew this.

Nathanael’s penis strained against his pants, urging to get out. Anwa’s hand somehow was down there now, grappling with his belt. This woman was his. He knew this in the depths of his soul. It hit him so hard again, that he felt light headed, not quite able to comprehend the series of events, all he could do was ride the wave.

She suddenly had her hand inside his pants, her fingers wrapping around his penis.

He couldn’t take it anymore. He yanked her pants off roughly, stuffing them underneath her buttocks, adjusting her deerskin coat underneath her warm body to serve as a blanket. Her eyes gleamed back at him in the dark night. Her breath came out in heavy rapid gusts.

“Yes,” she murmured.

That’s all he needed.

Him and her are two young people of 22 and 23 years of age.. 

one day they meet and fall in love and go to live together.. they are very in love with each other, but there is a problem: she has no job, she's looking for it, and he looses his one after few days.. 

one day, at the park, she meets a kind old man who goes in that park everyday for a walk.. they start to chat, and they establish a good friendship.. she tells him what's going on, he is generous and supportive, feels sad about her situation and hopes for her she will find a job soon.. 

everyday, after spending many hours looking for a job, she takes a break and goes to the park for a short walk and sometimes she encounters the old man too.. 

weeks go by and neither he nor she can find a job, but still they are in love, they still want to live together, but they will have to pay the rent very soon.. she meets the old man again, who notices her worried expression, asks her what's up and she explains him she's very desperate.. he understands and offers her such an opportunity: he is old and alone, he has a lot of money, his life is nearly at the end and he would like to feel affection for one last time before dying.. he would give her a lot of money if she accepts to be cuddled by him, just for a couple of minutes (note, it's not about a sexual intercourse).. she gets scared, says no and runs away home.. 

but as days go by and no jobs show up and the rent day approaches faster and faster, she starts reconsidering the man's offer and thinks that being cuddled by an old man (who is a good friend) wouldn't be that bad.. moreover she loves her boyfriend and she promised to herself she would do anything for him.. 

she goes to the old man saying she accepts his offer, and she lets herself being cuddled and kissed all over her body.. as promised it doesn't last more than an hour and the man gives her a very high reward.. and they promise to keep this secret and not tell it to anyone, especially to her boyfriend.. 

at home, she tells her beloved she met an old man who needed a help with his computer and he paid for her assistance, and he will need more help over the next days.. he's so happy about that and they start feeling relieved.. 

over the following few days she goes to the old man again and by the end of the week she manages to collect enough money to pay the rent.. 


Epilogue: 

luckily her boyfriend found a job in another city after a few days, so they relocated, she said thanks to the old man and she never met him again.. but she was a honest person and eventually she confessed her boyfriend the truth and said that for love she would have done even such a thing, but that she didn't consider that as a cheat on him, as there was no intercourse, nor feeling of love.. he understood her and they both soon forgot about those difficult days, as they were living finally happily.. 


Questions:

- Do you agree that for love some people are ready to sacrifice their dignity and do things they would never do, but which in turn will save their relationships? 
- What would you have done if you were her, when you were offered the old man's opportunity? 
- What would you have done if you were him, when she confessed you the truth?

I’ve been thinking about you. 

It’s hard not to when you’re always by my side. Often, so close, I get amnesia. What even is this? I’m ready to leave the rom-com...but I guess the rom-com isn’t ready to leave me.

Let’s go back to last week for a minute. There I am, sitting in a creaky green chair casually sipping a cappuccino next to you... I found myself savoring your bittersweet instead of the coffee’s.

Every now and then while we’re talking I sense your anxiety bubbling up and spilling out. I’ll watch your eyes flicker for a moment in deep-set embarrassment and frustration. It’s almost as though anxiety is an old friend whose company you expect, and you’re already primed to tell them to fuck off. Yet, every word that touches your lips turns to gold. These mild tremors of anxiety fill out every corner of your expansive enthusiasm. In fact, it adds to your charisma because it’s as though you become possessed by life itself.

Never has this anxiety threatened your passion or determination because you simply morph it into excitement. That my friend is true integration. I don’t know how long this took you to master, or how difficult it was but I can see it. No doubt it must have required extensive and constant work and I respect you for that.

In truth, you make a hyperactive fight or flight response sexy.

One moment I could be talking to you about global politics and you’d become so excited by the topic you might stumble over the words... But if you wanted, you could still chuck an entire person through a window with ease. The more I get to know you the more surprised I am.

You’re a fusion of old-age country class and modern Marvel intellectual. And... I love every second of it. Being the cynic I am, I’ll never tell you. In the time being, the feelings can just shhh.

One thing I will never understand about you... is how such ice blue eyes can feel so warm they burn. I never expected them to burn and the ensuing pain that follows... it’s just part of the experience.

It’s sad to push you away. To constantly let you go. To always stay a bit distant. Watching you believe I don’t feel the same. Then watching you date someone else.

My life is too painful for someone like you.

I will never let you care too much about me, but will selfishly fall for you in silence. Call me the devil for taking away your choice... but I would never let you love someone like me. Most of all me.

Until next time,

I really cared about this girl and I think I may have just spazzed out and pushed her away as a reaction to the stress I was under at the time.

Reasons for breaking up with her:
1. I felt like I was loosing myself, I didn’t like the man I saw in the mirror
2. I felt dirty about having sex and sneaking around
3. Her brother and I used to be friends but we hate each other and he always tried to cause drama
4. She always tried to defend her brother
5. I didn’t feel like I could relate to her
6. Sometimes I think she saw me as some kind of “prize” like I was a trophy to all her friends
7. I’m going to college soon

Looking at all these reasons I still feel like I made a terrible mistake by breaking things off with her. She really cared about me and I wonder if I’ll ever find someone like her again. 

About 2 weeks after we split up she rebounded which kinda still bugs me (call me deplorable or a narcissistic I don’t care I loved her and it hurts to see her with someone else). I fear that because I hurt her I’ll never find another girl again. 

I know I know I’m that typical high school kind that thinks he found “the one” but I just genuinely think that I’ll never find someone as loving and caring as her. It’s been eating away at my mind. I’ve been trying to find new hobbies and go to the gym but it follows me everywhere I go. I don’t want to be upset about this anymore but I just can’t help it. 

I’m not a super attractive guy. I’m fairly skinny and short. I know what everyone says about being happy with who you are and all that stuff. I’m sure in time I’ll be okay but I just really worry that she was a gift to me and I’ll never find someone again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m 17/m, I recently broke up with my ex and I think I made a horrible mistake.

Recently, however, I started being more open and joking around with him. We constantly keep saying the same things at the same times, etc, and it just started seeming pretty great. That is until my friend comes along (who doesn't know I like him. I frankly don't trust her enough).

Anyways, she's very forward about her crush on him, to the point of leaning her head on his shoulder, constantly texting him, etc, to the point of seeming obsession. I found out the other that he used to have a crush on me in some recent time, and might still. But now I'm not so sure.

He might like her back, actually. I see his friends tease him a bit about her but I don't know if it's because he likes her, or because they see how forward she is towards him and are just pairing them. We went on a school trip recently, and that's when she really made sure to stick by him and be close to him the entire time, and since then he kind of has seemed a little crushy toward her? I have no idea since I'm kinda bad at reading that stuff.

 He's always seemed a little bit ""off"" towards me though--like his usually loud demeaner gets a little quieter around me, and stuff like that. Recently, out of desperation, I've started getting a little bolder. I started a conversatiom through text with him, and surprisingly he kept it going and even restarted it the next day. But I know my somewhat friend also texts him like constantly.

But I'm a little old fashioned, so I am not letting myself go as far out as she is.

On my own.

Then you reached out to check on me when I left my husband. You – an old close friend from our high school days. You who I’ve always thought of fondly and wished nothing but the best for. We were so close that to me, you were as family.             

You who always made our time together as friends wonderful. You expected nothing of me, we had fun together, and you were always understanding and supportive even when I was at my very worst. You who I hadn’t heard from in years with the exception of being your support system when your own serious relationship failed you, and of course the requisite birthday wishes on Social Media.

I hope you knew that I always wondered about you. Hoped you were happy, hoped you were thriving. I loved you in so many ways (still do), and wanted nothing but your success and happiness. 

Unsurprisingly, you’re still the most amazing man I know. While going through a divorce I find myself suddenly immersed in an outpouring of your support, friendly distraction, banter, and wisdom. 

We’ve reconnected, we’ve fallen in love, and while we’re just a few short months in, I’ve never had a love like this. This thing that we’re doing has already been the most rewarding relationship I’ve ever had.

Sure it’s long distance, but that’s a temporary condition. We’ve counted the days between visits, we’ve spent all of our nights together and we’ve connected on a level I have never before. I talk to you about things, without hesitation, with a comfort level I never have never had before. 

You tell me that I bring out the best version of you, and make you feel whole, and that couldn’t be more accurate, for both of us. 

We are now less than a month away from the end of the long distance part of this relationship, and whatever the future holds for us, I can’t wait to explore it with you.

And if for some reason we don’t work out in the long term, boy have you ever set a high bar for any future partners… (Though not so secretly, I’m really rooting for us! ;) )

Neither of us is perfect, there are no perfect people. I only know that we’re imperfectly perfect for each other, and I cannot wait to be reunited in person for more than a visit.

If I get her back you better BELIEVE I will gush like crazy on here","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This world confuses me, I didnt understand I loved you until you left, everyone says that but I truly didnt understand myself until you left for someone else. I cant bring myself to hate you, I still love you like crazy, thinking about you all day, at some moments I think we will get back together and some I think you will never talk to me again, you hurt me like crazy at the end there everyone says I should hate you and move on but this is really tough girl. And now I have to think of this new girl, when we were dating I could simply reject all the other girls by saying I was with  you... but now what do I do I still love you and there is a beautiful girl wanting me and your not here, do I go ahead and try to love her? do I keep trying with you? what do I do... every fibre of my being is telling me to not give up on you, persevere it will be worth it in the long run, and I cant give up i dream of you I dream of holding you in my arms again, I dream of late nights talking about nothing, I crave your touch. Im so confused your with someone else ( granted you have told me he isnt the one) but I cant give up, I always hated sleeping around always, I only want  you, I pray every day to god to give you back. I dont know how long these feelings will last, 2 months more? 6? a year? who knows. But i want to keep trying as long as these feelings are here, once  these feelings are gone naturally and i didnt have to force anything thats when I can give up, it doesnt matter what anyone else says as long as I feel this way I really dont want to give up, and thats not fair to this new girl right? I cant play with her emotions like that its awful, so im confused do I force moving on to her or do I hold hope we will make this word. damn you stupid girl if only you had told me things we would never have gotten here, but maybe I just didnt listen. I love you, I hope you can love this 6&amp;#39;8 idiot again... i am sorry girlie.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m going to do it. Nothing has ever felt more right. I fucking woke up this morning and I knew that the ache that had been coursing through my whole body was because I had given up on us. Just the idea of actually trying to win her back has made me infinitely happier. 

It’s only been a month, we broke up mutually because I told her I couldn’t keep going and she agreed it was best for us. I have had so much time to wallow in my own pity and filth for the past month though and I’ve grown to understand exactly what happened. I always knew it was because of me, but now I understand it. She was perfect in every way but I was SCARED. I have never had someone love me the way that she did, I have never had someone reciprocate those feelings.

I’ve been cheated on, I’ve been hurt constantly but she loved me, she cherished me—just as I did. I was scared, I didn’t give her anything really. I was mean and sour. This came from a place of fear, but I was also finishing a degree and I was obsessed with ‘making it’ in my industry. I didn’t ever take her out to dinner, I never hung out with her friends and she accepted that. She loved me nonetheless. 

I came to realise how shit I was and that’s when I broke things off because “she deserved better”. How stupid is that fucking sentence? I couldn’t just suck it up and be a better person to the person that loves me the most in the world. Well I could, but I decided not to. So what did I do? I let the best thing that ever happened to me go, I let her go out of fear, laziness... out of stupidity.

I have grown so much in the past month. I’m ready now, I’m ready to give her this love that she deserves. I’m going to beg for her forgiveness and if all goes well I’ll have her in my arms by Sunday night. 

I understand that there’s a chance that she’ll reject me, I really do, but fuck it... fuck all of it, I need to try. 

Listen to me you bunch of idiots, listen fucking closely. DO not let them go. Love is love. Love is everything in this world, so accommodate it, let it grow and let it motivate your every move in this life.

So I been on an student exchange to France. Apparently there have been only French girls taken part in it. So I ended up with with her for one week. Unfortunately I can't speak French, but this  wasn't a requirement for taken part in the exchange. She is 16 and speaks perfect german (I am german and a 17 year old guy) and she was really nice and kind to me and didn't bother that I don't speak French. This was the first real student exchange I attended so everything was kinda  new to me. She attended to five other student exchanges before (all to germany) so I was the six ed exchange student she had, but the first guy. 

This week was amazing, really I had so much fun with her and I spend a lot of time with her laughing, talking about stuff and just generally having a good time.But unfortunately I was getting feelings for her.
But I really dont know if she has the same feelings for me. Cause she is giving me mixed signs. On one day we laugh a lot having great conversations and all that but then sometimes she is just not in the mood about talking. On one day she is telling that she never had a boyfriend before and the next day she is just not really interested in me. 

The think is she got me. I am thinking about her atleast once a day and I never experienced this feeling before.

You're the nicest person I've ever meet and I can't stop thinking about you. After everything I've been through 4 years ago, I lost everything I could rely on, my dreams and my plans for the future juste broke into pieces and I completely lost hope. I can't trust anyone anymore, I had the proof that I can't even trust my parents and you're the only exception to that. I though I wouldn't be able to stay alive for long but you gave me strenght. 

&amp;#x200B;

At a time where everyone had lost the most basic of common sense when talking about me, I felt I'll have to live hidden forever from the madness of the society we live in, but you talked about rationality, science and how to stay away from manipulations. You have no idea how much I needed to hear this. You gave me the strenght to go to uni everyday and study harder than ever, and I had my best grades ever thanks to you.I never dared to think I could have actually good grades one day. I did it for you and you will never know that, and it hurts. But I keep thinking that's the only thing you ever expected from me so I did it.

&amp;#x200B;

When the others let me down with all the work to do we looked together for a word to describe them and all I could came with was a weird word for which I wasn't even sure of the definition. And you told me ""I understand, it happens to me too"" and I think you will never understand how much this meant to me. That's the only thing I needed to hear.

But then thinking about it I remembered that I did nothing bar showing up - and I actually expected the rest of the group to have worked a little bit - and maybe you meant you where the one who did all that work - and that's true. I'm sorry I didn't worked at all that day,  I just hope that's not what you meant. You're a bit of a cynical person and that's something you could have said, but I will never know since I don't get subtext.

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling safe near you gave me confidence and ambitions for the next year, but I never felt that way before and I ended up being super rude and cocky and embarrassing in hindsight. I'm so ashamed and sorry for everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was terrified about getting surgery for my eyes, but after meeting you I decided to get it anyway so one day I would be able to look at you without needing to hide my eyes. You saved my eyesight but we haven't seen each other for more than one year so what was the point of it anyway ? I'm turning into a ludicrous mess, looking at your twitter everyday before going to bed even if you're the kind of person who only posts once a month in a language I can't even read, and about stuff I couldn't understand anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I know you're married and I know I have no chance, because you care so much about ethics, honesty and integrity and that's the exact reason why I love you. I'm not even jealous of your wife and you too breaking up would break my heart. Your children look adorable and I'm so happy for you. I won't ever dare to try talking to you because you deserve to have the happiest of families, not an embarassing mess like me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish we could talk and have fun together but we won't 'cause in one month I'll be moving and I will never see you again.

We have no genie making us love each other, but we might aswell have!   


I was always a shy person, but I got bolder and bolder when the day before Christmas, I was riding a  bus to my home town and a really cute girl sat next to me and fell asleep. I really liked her looks but could not speak to her, bad luck. My friend told me to just give her my number on a note. Just like that. I did. And it worked out perfectly!   


We fell in love, texting nonstop during Christmas. Our first date was already perfect, second date even better!  


She is harsh and takes no shit, exactly like Yennefer. And I am sulky, complaining and argumentative, just as Geralt, except with her, just like Geralt :D . Which makes me a much better person, because lets face it... she is smarter than I am. And if we have an argument, 90% of the time she has the right of it and I just concede. And it feels amazing to finaly find a soulmate, where everything is so perfect that even the arguments make the relationship better! I need someone to keep me in check and sometimes just call me on my bullshit, she is this person and life is so much better with her!   


Oh, do not worry. I got her back aswell! She needs reasuring that things will be ok, that our life will work out and that we are certainly not failing at life. She needs someone to be strong for her, and I sure as hell can do that! 

She is a perfect 10 as looks go, she is funny, smart, wise and hard working. A perfect GF for sure.   


So just keep on, people! My life changed with her, after one bus ride where I wrote one note with my number on it. Completely random encounter, worked out perfectly. 

Arguments are not neccesarily bad, it helps let off steam and clear things up, just be civil and know when to stop and how! So it does not turn into a bad fight.

Never meant to like you so much
Never meant to care for a long time

Agreed to keep it as a summer fling

Everything just felt so good
So right

My heart was beating too fast and too loud

I tried to cover my ears

And ignore the strong feelings

But my control eroded every time you walked into the room

A foolish puddle on the floor

Then real life returned

To tangle us in its complex web

Then everything stopped

Your kisses Your smooth skin next to mine
Your hugs
Your conversation

The connection went dead

And then I fell

I kept dreaming of you and this perfect holiday that you had planned for us before we ended everything. My bed is always empty without you now. Before you came into my life I loved spreading out, now I need to cuddle a pillow just to try and fall asleep. 

Thank goodness I kept one of your t-shirts by accident. I try not to disturb it too much as I don’t want to rid it of your smell. Sometimes I find a hair in my bed, my heart gets all flustered hoping it’s yours, but it never is anymore.

You used to litter my room with your long hairs, your laughs and the underwear you’d chuck across the room. I used to watch you sleep in the mornings, kissing you ever so slightly—just enough to make you toss and turn a bit. 

I’ll admit it now, you made me a better person, a better man, a better son and a better lover. You took someone that was broken and swept up every last piece before glueing me back together.

I’ve done this before, I won’t spew the usual “I’ll never find anyone like you ever again” bullshit because it’s not true. Every love is different and I’ll feel this again, but I know what was different about your love. I know how I’ll categorise the love you offered me every day with a smile.

Your love was the love I needed then. Your love was the love I have needed my whole life up until now. I’m a bit of a lost traveller and I always have been. I needed a cuddler, I needed someone that would stroke my hair and whisper things that would only be kept between us and the universe. I stained your pillows with so many of my tears as you cradled me and told me you would never let me go. That it was ‘us’ against it all. 

You know what I regret the most? Not liking to hold your hand in public. I also regret not going to your prom. I have cried about that many times at this point. Who the fuck am I to not sweep you off your feet in your beautiful dress? Why do I do these things? Why did I hurt you? Your beautiful little soul deserves more than I ever gave you. 

Perhaps I miss you now because I know what I would have done differently. I ask myself whether I would actually be able to do it, to love someone unconditionally without tainting it with my tantrums. I guess it won’t be me, it never really ends up being me.

I’m usually taken over as a project and then passed on to the next without any instructions. You were so close to finishing me, to being the last one. I wanted it to be you, I wanted nothing more. 

I still love you, you idiot and I know that you know that. I know you still love me too, but thank you for not agreeing to see me. Thank you for not agreeing to call me and for taking ages to answer my texts. Thank you, because I don’t have the strength to stay away from you.

Enjoy your summer my love, I hope you find everything you’ve always looked for. I hope you smile the whole way through and that by the end of the year you sort things out with your therapist. You’re such a wonderful person, maybe I didn’t deserve you, maybe it wasn’t right, but someone will.

It's one person ofcourse. It's really long long story and I'm too lazy to write everything and you are too lazy to read it all. So I will try to write just most important things.

We were classmates for 8 years (we graduated from high school lately). But it all started 5 years ago. We were best friends. Ofcourse I was in love. Yeah just me. We hang out a lot. Everytime we was together we had so much fun. It was just so easy with her. But she hurt me a lot. She had 3 boyfriends until we get together. It was very painful for me because when she was in relationship we couldn't hang out that much. And you can imagine how I felt. My mind was destroying me. I was imagining what they are doing. How she laughs with him like she is laughing with me. I just couldn't stop thinking about it. My friends was telling me that I should get rid of her. That she is destroying me. But I always felt that I just have to wait. That one day we will be together. I always had that feeling that how can I just forget her? How can I let her go? I was thinking that if I will be patient she will realize who she got and she will appreciate that I have stayed after all.

2 years ago we got together. It was miracle for me. I thought that this is it. I was right. What I felt and what I believed has happened. I was glad that I wasn't listening to my friends and I believed in myself. It was really wonderful, first month... Second was also nice but I started feeling that she doesn't truly love me. She hasn't done anything bad but I felt it. Like I felt we will be together. After 3 and half month we broke up via messenger. Right after that my dad told me that my dog ran somewhere. It was raining. I grabbed umbrella and went seek him. I was on the ""small hill""? (I'm from village)  and was screaming ""BAARNEEEY!"". He didn't show up. I throw away my umbrella and start crying like a child. My gf has broke up with me and my dog has been lost. I felt like shit. 

We told ourselves that we will stay friends. Yeah I love that one. Tell me another:) we were classmates and we didn't even say hi in next 5 months. Everytime we saw each other it was like a slap. After cca 5 months we texted. I don't remember who started. But she told me that this is weird and we need to talk. So we went for o coffee and it was like nothing happened. It was little bit wierd at the begging but after few minutes we was making same old jokes. I don't know how it is called. But you know that jokes that only you 2 understand. This was happening everytime we had and argument. No matter how long we wasn't talking. Everytime we was together it was the same.

After we became friends again she had another boyfriend. It was weird again. It was weird for me to spend much time with girl that has boyfriend and same for her. But we was friends. After they broke up (it lasted about 6 months). She had some affairs after that I know about. (I mean kissing. Not sex.) (Btw. we didn't have sex. Just to mention.) 

Last summer was great. First half. We spend much time together. Then she told me she is going to work in Holland for 5 weeks. I was little bit sad but it's normal thing. I was working too but at the near city. So when she was there we had argument again. Since then we wasn't that good friends. This semester was worst in our relationship. To be honest I was getting along with it better then when I was younger. Maybe I'm more mature now and can handle it better. So this time it was different. We was friends but it wasn't ""real"". But I always had that feeling that I don't want to lost all of this.

Last few weeks I started to text her. She wasn't really into it but I wasn't too intrusive. Then we started calling from time to time. Yesterday morning we want skating together (on rollerblades), in the afternoon we went swimming and after that we went eating. It wasn't date. I don't know how to call it but it was same as five years ago. I don't mean place we went but the chemistry. Also when we was eating she told me:"" I don't understand how we can talk to each other after all"" 

I have never lost my feeling about us. I'm not crazy in love. But I feel like she is the one. We have that something after all that years and I'm 100% sure it will never change.

I have never lost that feeling of hope.
So I'm questioning myself everyday. What will happen? What if after all I just end up with different girl. Should I carry on and keep hurting myself? 

Maybe I'm dreamer. Maybe I'm dumb. But feeling that maybe one day I will tell myself ""you did it, it was worth it"" drives me forward.

I will be grateful for every comment you will write.

If everyone is loved, we wont have people devoting their lives to specific tasks, jobs, and goals. You see these sort of people all the time.

Personally, I dont feel I deserved to be loved. I see myself as a black soul, a caged monster waiting to get out. Its definitely the warrior's soul in me aching to get out. Im aware that we can make our flaws seem worse than they are, but I fear losing control of myself. Due to said fear, I strive to be the person Id like to be, the kind of person the world needs. A warrior in a time of peace. I help people the best I could, I hold myself accountable for everything I do, put the needs of others before my own, and try to be self aware at all times. Despite all that, I feel as if Im fighting against what I believe to be my true nature. Which makes any kindness I provide the world feel shallow and self serving, even if I dont think about the consequences of the kind act. In my mind and heart I feel like if you truly love someone, youd want them to be safe, and not be the source of their troubles or danger. So, I deny any chance I get at love. Is this the right move?

But it’s becoming clear to me that she doesn’t care at all about me, and she’s not really the same person I fell in love with. I didn’t want this to go to waste so a friend suggested I post it here. I dunno. 

Hey, um. I can’t sleep so. I know I’m gonna have to have this talk with you soon, and I’m not looking forward to it. But I might as well start mapping out what I’m going to say. Lately, my life has been going to shit. When. Things got really bad for me, it was a mixture of                bad influence and the looming threat of how shitty my life was going to get. I saw it coming, and the fact it was coming scared me and now it’s here. So life is definitely not fun right now. And I’ll admit, it’s a little hard to find things to keep moving forward for. I really only have two things, the best friends I have ever had, and something I have wanted my entire life, true love. I tried to tell you about this back in January, and it didn’t go so well. When it comes to trying to express my feelings for you; anything that can go wrong will go wrong. But it always feels like I’m right on the cusp of a great breakthrough. I have so many ideas in my head, so many thoughts, so many dreams, and they’re all so wonderful. I plan out exactly what to say and do, and then I look into your big brown eyes and it all goes out the window. Everything inside starts speeding up really fast. My heart starts beating rapidly, my thoughts race a mile a minute and I start worrying about how awkward my smile is or if I’m making too much eye contact or if I’m sweating too much. I’m sure that all comes off super unattractive and like I’m trying too hard. I wish I could turn my brain off, be effortless and cool because that’s how I try to be all of the time. But it’s hard because for one of the few times in my life I actually care, and that scares the shit out of me. I’m able to risk my life walking over that bridge to Elmwood like it’s nothing but something as simple as telling the girl next door that she looks really pretty today feels like a Herculean task. I’m afraid of being too much, I suppose. I know you want your space and I try not to be that guy who keeps bringing it up. But the result is that the only time I really let my feelings out to you is when I’m rolling and that probably comes off as, “I’m super fucked up and just want some booty.” So that strategy backfires. I try to say stuff that I think is sweet and endearing like the EDC Fireworks thing but I don’t know if I get the desired effect. But, one of these days I’m gonna have to man up and get through this, and it sounds like time is running out so if you’ll just pardon me this one last time. Here we go. I love you,                              . I can say that with the same exactness I would reading a fact out of a textbook. I’m sure you’ve probably heard that already from a lot of different guys but I can almost guarantee they don’t mean it like I do. Because my love for you isn’t based in how much I like your looks (which I very much do) or how good you are at sex or anything like that, which seems to be how most people approach love these days. No, my love for you is rooted in the ways you both inspire and challenge me as a human being. You were the first person to give me a shred of confidence in myself. You are the kind of person that pushes people to be the very best they can be, and because of that I met the best friends I have ever had. I know I’ve written this a million times but I love the way you look at the world, it’s beautiful. I used to be extremely cynical but your hope and wonder have really had a profound effect on me. You’re the person who taught me what the word beautiful really means, both in the context of people and the world around them. If you would have told me a few years ago that I would willingly wake up early to go pick up garbage all day I wouldn’t have believed it. But like they said on Arrow, if you love someone and can’t figure out how to show it, find something important to them and make it important to you. And because I took that leap I found something that I actually enjoy that nurtures my soul. I feel like I have a purpose again, like I am doing something that matters for once, even just a little bit. I want to make the world as beautiful as it can possibly be for you, because that’s exactly what you’ve done for me. And I can sit here and talk about lovey dovey stuff like all of the letters I’ve written or the song playlists I’ve made or all that romantic shit I like, but at the end of the day, I can’t think of anything that proves what I’m saying better than that. I’ve never been one to want to travel around or go outside of my comfort zone but when you’re around it makes it easier. I just, feel better when you’re around. I feel safe, there’s just something about your smile that lets me know that everything is going to be alright. And let me tell you that really comes in handy at work when things get bad. Speaking of which, I can’t even begin to count how many times a shift has gone horribly wrong and all I want to do is wrap you up in my arms and hold you close for hours. Sometimes it’s so strong I can physically feel the pain in my arms of not having you near. It’s just, nice to be close to you. My deepest desire in this world is to have one dance with you, just like Steve and Peggy. I feel like you’d be the perfect dance partner cuz you’re at just the right height. I’ve played that dream over and over and over in my head so many times, which made it all the more special when I saw the exact same scene play out in Avengers: Endgame. Same song and all. There’s a line in that song that says, “you’ll never know how many dreams I dream about you, or just how empty they all seem without you.” And that verse just hits me deep in my soul, ya know? I dunno, maybe you don’t. I know you don’t want to be tied down, and I get it, we’re young and we have so much time to spare. But, and this is the part of the conversation I really don’t want to have but fuck it, all or nothing. I can recall about seven times that my life could have ended already. Whether it was by my own hand or some freak accident, there have been seven times I can clearly remember that my life almost ended. And it very easily could have not gone my way any of those seven times. So I guess when you see that happen enough you realize that nothing in this world is guaranteed. It’s easy to feel like we’re invincible and that we’re all going to live until we’re a hundred but that could also not be the case at all. So, I for one don’t want to waste any more time. But even if you don’t want to be with me, the wonderful thing is, I don’t need you to love me back, though of course I would vastly prefer it. I could go the rest of my life without kissing you or holding you ever again and still live a fulfilling life; because what I want out of us goes so much deeper than kissing or fucking. I want to explore as much of this crazy, wild world we live in as possible. I want to travel to strange new places with you, eat weird food, go scuba diving, bungee jumping. Mini-golfing? One day find a really good place to sit under the stars and finally see some constellations. The list goes on, and if the only way I can do all of those things is as your friend then that’s good enough for me. Because at the end of the day all that really matters to me is that you’re there. I suppose I should probably wrap this up, it is getting a little long. I’ll leave you with this. I’m sorry that I make things weird and awkward for you, it’s never my intention. All I’m ever really trying to do is make you smile. Because your smile is my favorite work of art. My greatest achievement will always be the next time that I make you smile.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this to explain my feelings for the girl I love. But it’s becoming clear to me that she doesn’t care at all about me, and she’s not really the same person I fell in love with. I didn’t want this to go to waste so a friend suggested I post it here. I dunno. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, um. I can’t sleep so. I know I’m gonna have to have this talk with you soon, and I’m not looking forward to it. But I might as well start mapping out what I’m going to say. Lately, my life has been going to shit. When. Things got really bad for me, it was a mixture of                bad influence and the looming threat of how shitty my life was going to get. I saw it coming, and the fact it was coming scared me and now it’s here. So life is definitely not fun right now. And I’ll admit, it’s a little hard to find things to keep moving forward for. I really only have two things, the best friends I have ever had, and something I have wanted my entire life, true love. I tried to tell you about this back in January, and it didn’t go so well. When it comes to trying to express my feelings for you; anything that can go wrong will go wrong. But it always feels like I’m right on the cusp of a great breakthrough. I have so many ideas in my head, so many thoughts, so many dreams, and they’re all so wonderful. I plan out exactly what to say and do, and then I look into your big brown eyes and it all goes out the window. Everything inside starts speeding up really fast. My heart starts beating rapidly, my thoughts race a mile a minute and I start worrying about how awkward my smile is or if I’m making too much eye contact or if I’m sweating too much. I’m sure that all comes off super unattractive and like I’m trying too hard. I wish I could turn my brain off, be effortless and cool because that’s how I try to be all of the time. But it’s hard because for one of the few times in my life I actually care, and that scares the shit out of me. I’m able to risk my life walking over that bridge to Elmwood like it’s nothing but something as simple as telling the girl next door that she looks really pretty today feels like a Herculean task. I’m afraid of being too much, I suppose. I know you want your space and I try not to be that guy who keeps bringing it up. But the result is that the only time I really let my feelings out to you is when I’m rolling and that probably comes off as, “I’m super fucked up and just want some booty.” So that strategy backfires. I try to say stuff that I think is sweet and endearing like the EDC Fireworks thing but I don’t know if I get the desired effect. But, one of these days I’m gonna have to man up and get through this, and it sounds like time is running out so if you’ll just pardon me this one last time. Here we go. I love you,                              . I can say that with the same exactness I would reading a fact out of a textbook. I’m sure you’ve probably heard that already from a lot of different guys but I can almost guarantee they don’t mean it like I do. Because my love for you isn’t based in how much I like your looks (which I very much do) or how good you are at sex or anything like that, which seems to be how most people approach love these days. No, my love for you is rooted in the ways you both inspire and challenge me as a human being. You were the first person to give me a shred of confidence in myself. You are the kind of person that pushes people to be the very best they can be, and because of that I met the best friends I have ever had. I know I’ve written this a million times but I love the way you look at the world, it’s beautiful. I used to be extremely cynical but your hope and wonder have really had a profound effect on me. You’re the person who taught me what the word beautiful really means, both in the context of people and the world around them. If you would have told me a few years ago that I would willingly wake up early to go pick up garbage all day I wouldn’t have believed it. But like they said on Arrow, if you love someone and can’t figure out how to show it, find something important to them and make it important to you. And because I took that leap I found something that I actually enjoy that nurtures my soul. I feel like I have a purpose again, like I am doing something that matters for once, even just a little bit. I want to make the world as beautiful as it can possibly be for you, because that’s exactly what you’ve done for me. And I can sit here and talk about lovey dovey stuff like all of the letters I’ve written or the song playlists I’ve made or all that romantic shit I like, but at the end of the day, I can’t think of anything that proves what I’m saying better than that. I’ve never been one to want to travel around or go outside of my comfort zone but when you’re around it makes it easier. I just, feel better when you’re around. I feel safe, there’s just something about your smile that lets me know that everything is going to be alright. And let me tell you that really comes in handy at work when things get bad.

When I was in love I hated it so much, I really disliked all the feelings I was

experiencing, I felt so overwhelmed, eaten by emotions, it was unbearable,

everything was so irrational.

It felt good making love though, this powerful mental connection made sex

awesome, and my orgasms were more intense, it was a genital paradise, but

out of bed I really disliked being in love, I was feeling mentally sick.

I have never been a romantic person, so I decided to explore the chemical

of my brain, I questioned myself what was happening to my mind while I

was in love, what it was the chemical reaction behind it, and I got my

explanation that I am glad to share with you: love occurs when the

psychosis of the synapses matches. When we are in love our dopamine

increases, this is what makes us feel energetic towards our partner, at the

same time our cortisol gets higher as well, cortisol is the stress hormone ,

and the serotonin which is the stress-busting neurotransmitter decreases.

The imbalance between dopamine and serotonin makes us feel “bipolar”

towards our partner, we feel pleasure, but at the same time we are stressed

as fuck. This process of being in love and crazy lasts a couple of years, after

that our serotonin will increases, and we will feel less obsessed with our

partner, basically we are in come down (which means it’s the end of the

story, our partner stinks, he’s a fucking dickhead and everything sucks) .

During this phase our oxytocin, the love hormone, will increase as well, this

hormone is responsible for social bonding and it’s produced during

orgasms and birth process, it deepens feelings of attachment, it has to be

said that the more oxytocin increases the more testosterone decreases, so

less sex.

To keep couple together our brain produces a chemical called

corticotropin-releasing which is released whenever partners are physically

separated, it produces an unpleasant feeling, which gets better once they

are together again. Romantic love is the most addictive drug, in fact like

addicts, couples experience tolerance, withdrawal, relapse, and suffer from

obsessive behavior .

What do I mean when i say: “love occurs when the psychosis of the

synapses matches”? By that I mean that we fall in love when the chemical

of our brain works in a similar way and our neurons are stuck in the same

process that generates a psychosis (detachment from reality/ distorted

perspective) of our synapses structures that permit to a neuron to pass an

electical or chemical signal to another neuron. When this occurs, we click

and we feel understood, this makes us see the person we fall in love perfect

for us, in fact we are perfectly miserable together, but it’s not a good

approach to life, in my opinion.

## What area of our brain lust and love activate?

They affect two parts: the insula and the striatum.

Lust begins the pleasure center of the striatum, when our sexual desire

becomes love, they appear to still be processed in the striatum but in a

different area. This area is activated by love, and it involves the process of

giving value to things that give us pleasure: food, sex, drugs, etc.

Love works exactly like a drug, it’s a habit which is formed from sexual

desire as a desire is rewarded, it is exactly what happens in a brain

addicted to drugs.

### Why do I dislike romantic love?

I think it’s a cancer, I hate this feeling of jealousy and possession typical of

romantic love, and all the chemical reaction doesn’t make me feel good, it’s

just an illusion. I feel obsessed, and mentally sick, it’s exhausting. Out of bed

it completely sucks, romantic love is not true love, it’s just a mental trip,

absolutely irrational, that creates suffering and makes you feel vulnerable.

It’s generated from a lack of human love that surrounds us, people want to

fill their emotional holes through this sick love everybody is craving due to

a lack of awareness, romantic love is like a murder, murdering is like

making love during romantic love, these awesome feelings you experience

will just traumatize your emotional sphere, and it’s too hard to admit it was

just an illusion, a distorted perspective of life, but it is , and I think we

should be aware of what happens to our brain to be able to choose how to

cope with it.

#### How to love in a healthier way?

For me unconditional love is the solution. By unconditional love I mean

a soul connection where lust is not that strong, or completely absent. It’s a

free love that allows me not to be emotionally overwhelmed and able to

be rational and joyful if my soul mate finds joy no matter how. It’s a love

free of jealousy that doesn’t know any kind of competition, and gives a lot of

joy more than pain and suffering, typical of romantic love. Unconditional

love might lack butterflies sex, which means we can still enjoy it, without

feeling madly neurotic, although the orgasms are less intense, the

quality of life is absolutely much better, I consider it as a sane love, in

which I find interesting to invest my energies and my existence. I try to

avoid being in romantic love since I consider it a waste of time, coming

from a lack of love in our life, for instance childhood trauma or abuse,

absolutely destructive.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always been interested in people’s mind, especially in mine.&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to talk about my experiences and how they've lead to not really caring about finding or having love anymore, and how that's ok.

I think the first time i dated anyone was back in high school. Brutal times back then. Everything was going well until i got dumped via couriered phone recordings from my now ex who was crying in the girls locker room because of school rumors.

After one day of dating. Yikes.

That was probably my first red flag that love ain't all it's cracked up to be.

However, my last would have been when i met a Lady who I showed the world to, taking her out to dinner and even a concert. About three months later, my decision to leave my hometown is spurred on by finding out that she's a gold digger, and she's gone and left me for someone richer on a dating website who'll take her travelling internationally.

This whole scenario pushed me to leave my hometown and I haven't gone back since. In retrospect, affection makes a man do foolish things. However, for the 7 years I've left all that behind, i have been thriving.

Instead of going to bed whinging that i won't find someone, or feeling unloved, or trying my damnedest to find romance, I've all-together eliminated that foolish quest from my life. I have accepted that there isn't someone for everyone and that in the end, people do live alone to the end.

And Without the burden of love ceaselessly crushing my mind and my heart, i feel much better, living in willful ignorance of romance, affection and love. It just takes too much time and energy for what is, nigh a gamble today.

Why bother with relationships that could fall apart at a moment's notice because you said or did the wrong thing, when you could take that time and money and use it on yourself?

That's not to mention that there's a chance of false rape accusations or bad divorces screwing you over financially and socially.

So i present you all with another option- be loveless. Don't let love weigh your soul down.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey fellow hopeless romantics, good to see you all again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really intimidated by that. My dating history is patchy at best. I&amp;#39;m divorced. I think he probably deserves better than me. He can definitely do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But....on the other hand, he&amp;#39;s 34. He&amp;#39;s waited for the person who he thought was right, and he chose ME. It humbles me to think he saw something special in me, someone he wanted in his life. It just fills my heart with joy.&lt;/p&gt;

For as long as I can remember, I've sought that feeling, no matter what comes after.

I've been through a lot romantically at this point. I'm carrying baggage and covered in scars, among whatever other cliches you want to use. A woman once told me that she ""only want[ed] me when [she was] broken,"" which was devastating. I've been in what is probably more than my fair share of abusive relationships, too. Ones where my opinions didn't matter, ones where I was never doing enough and had to monitor the words I chose to the point where I decided not to speak as much because it was less mentally and emotionally exhausting.

Recently, I met someone who I thought I was on the same page with. We would see each other about once a week. We had an amazing connection, a lot in common, and seemed to enjoy each other's company. Then I made a gesture that was probably too much for her, and for the next two months she had very little time for me. I wondered what was wrong, what I had done before she broke up with me. I still wonder.

I've developed some kind of block that won't let me act on my feelings. And some major anxiety about a lack of communication. I've started seeing another woman. This one is slightly more available at times, but there are some weeks when I don't hear from her for a while, days at a time. That lack of communication is only increasing my anxiety.

We had an amazing date the last time I saw her. I was planning on it simply being a lunch date. We ended up spending much of the day together, though. I could feel my infatuation growing as she got excited over the board game we were playing. I started feeling things I hadn't in a long time when she let me put my arm around her on the sofa. I desperately wanted to kiss her, and I've been getting signals that she wanted me to, too, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

I'm second-guessing all of my instincts about this. I'm imagining the worst. I sent her a message after the date just telling her I really enjoyed myself and that I was looking forward to seeing her again. I threw a little bit of flowery language into it.

I didn't get a response. Nothing. For 2 days now. And I know she usually isn't the best at texting, but my mind is all over the place right now. She doesn't feel like the person who would hurt me the way others have, but I feel like I'm being careful, trying not to let myself get hurt, and the second I decided to open up a little bit, I'm afraid I'm being ghosted.

I don’t know how much you have trudged through the darkness of your own adversities, but I want to be understanding. I am offering my affection, comfort, and companionship. I want to glow through the dark clouds together, I can show you that I care and can make loving sacrifices. I don’t know where you see your light. But I want to know the end of the chapter, so we can begin a new one. So it is up to you if you see no future with us, or that we do have a beautiful hope. True love must be reciprocated, but I offered you my feelings, and I asked to hear yours. I want to hear your words. I want to be open with you without fear. I’ll pray for us until we part, then it will be a matter of finding what else is in store. We are arriving at a spectacular moment as we graduate high school, we will have an opportunity together. I just want to talk to you, aligning with your mesmerizing eyes and listening to your soft voice; hearing your enriching laughter, seeing your special smile, and let you know I want to convey my affection because you’re the special girl that deserves it. You are special because it’s you. I love you whether it be unrequited or it becomes a mutual and passionate love, I want to see what will happen with it. I want to see God’s answer for us. 

So, let’s see together. And I love you","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m in love with you as I simply think about you. When all of the bullcrap is away, when I am in the moment to myself, when I’m not fighting my emotions, when I’m not in combat with the evil forces of my mind, when I can accept the feelings for you and why I care about you, it is heavenly bliss that I’d love to share with you and only you. I am not ashamed to be in love with you. I am confident to love you. Nothing can defeat the ecstatic feelings your being gives me, I want to be good enough for you show we can share the high of love together. I want you in my life, I want to invite you and show you the hope we share together. I want to do everything I can for your happiness, even through all the pain and agony that may be. Even if you lock your heart from me, you are still the person that has been worth loving. I don’t regret it. I’ve made it here because of you. All the 11 years of knowing you, all the 8 years of my feelings for you, manifesting into the powerful love I have for you now. I just want you to know it’s innocent love, it’s the love I’ve prayed to God to sustain, all throughout the hardships and failures. I am a better person through it all, I want to be the man that is enough for you. A man can accept the suffering and see how he is rewarded for it, and to see if there is a woman waiting on the other side, willing to take the man’s hand. Nothing will ever be perfect. But it doesn’t need to be when I have my love for you.  You may not know to the extent I have been enthralled with you as a person, but I see light in our reality past through the glamorous fantasies that hindered me before. I want to see what God will do for us. I’ve presented my feelings for you in the best way I thought I could, I just wanted to be honest about the truth and try to make everything be the best for you. I don’t want you to be afraid, I want you to be comfortable. Tell me, tell me when it is right for you what your answer is, what you see.

To make it simple let's call the girl: Laura

The guy at her Place: John

So when I was 14 I met this amazing girl in my class. And I fell in love. She also had emotions for me I could read it from her face. But I was a player back and she was with one of my friends. So we texted a lot but that's it. A few years passed and I went to another school, we texted each other now and then for a short period of 1-2 weeks.

When i graduated high school, I asked her to go out with me, she did. She had a boyfriend back then but it went pretty bad between them 2 she said and she told me she never had the same feeling for him like she had with me, so she left him. And we became a couple, she was **my first love**. It was the best time our lives. I made her so happy and the same counted for me. She always stated I was her first TRUE love... We went on vacations and did close to everything together. At the university I took an appartement big enough for the 2 of us.

After one year the problems started... we didn't live officially together but she was at my place for 5/7 days &amp; nights of the week. I just started university after working for a year and I felt miserable because it was much harder then I expected and I just became depressed and didn't do a lot except hanging in bed all day and playing video games. She tried to push me every time and was there for me, she cooked, she cleaned. She proposed even to study together or to go with her to the library. Help me sorting my books for the exams... Then during the exam period I gave up because I started studying way to late, I had one more exam and asked her if it would bother her if I would go out with friends she said it was no problem. When I went out I walked in on her lil brother, we went out together the rest of the night. In the end we were super drunk and I asked him where he was sleeping and he said he was taking the first bus to school. So I told him that he could stay at my place. So he went back to my appartement with me, my girlfriend was studying so I asked him to be silent. He came inside and started puking everywhere, he just kept going for several hours. Because of this Laura couldn't sleep and failed her exam the next day. I felt so bad for what I did that I couldn't say anything, just nothing came out of my mouth, I could barely look at her. She said that it was the most disrespectful thing anyone has ever done to her, and that I didn't say anything not even a sorry the day after. We broke up for a week. During this week she was so broken that she started seeking attention of people on dating apps, eventually she went on a date with a much older guy, nothing happened. We talked it all out , she told me she was just so heartbroken that she needed someone that would give her love. I told her I understood after a good talk and we went back together. 2 Weeks later we still had the ski-vacation booked with her family. And so I went with her, I couldn't snowboard at all so the first days she learned me. And she was so pissed that she couldn't go with her family because I sucked to hard. I told her all the time she could go and I could learn by myself but she said she wouldn't do that because then she'd feel guilty. After a while I got pissed and told her I was going alone if she wants it or not and so I did. The first 3 days of the vacation were hard but the other 4 went well, we were happy together. When we got back we still had some damage in our relationship but everything went better and better. She decided to come less to my place but after a while she stayed for 2 or 3 nights a week.

A month or 2 passed and she wanted to take her horseback riding serious again. I told her it was okay and that I'll support her. Her horses are at home and she decided to ride them close to everyday. So she barely slept over anymore and I would only be able to see her during the midday break of university (we both go to the same university but we have lessons far from each other) or when I would go to her to the weekends. So I barely went to my own parents anymore and I came close to every weekend to her parents. I was always positive and tried to help with anything at her place or with the horses. Her parents really love me, but I didn't show a lot of love back. I was polite and happy but I hold off a distance between her parents and me, because I'm afraid to lose. This is something I'm struggling with my entire life after the loss of my grandparents, they were the only 2 people who were always their for me, my parents weren't. She went on a jumping with her horse and I came to see her. But I felt like it didn't mattered that much to her, and this is the moment were everything went downwards. She left me alone for a day at her place and I was pissed because I couldn't do anything, so I studied and played with her dog. Her parents were in her pool at home and asked if I didn't want to join, I said no thank you. While in my head I actually wanted to jump in the pool with them. She came back and I told her that she shouldn't let me be alone at her place, but her mom told her that they asked me to join. And she tried to understand me, but on that moment I couldn't or maybe didn't want to explain my feelings about it. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings with someone because I've been crushed down in the past, so I created this defensive mechanism. It's one of my worst characteristics. So I said I didn't wanted to swim and I was just bored. The next weekend she was thinking about it and tried her best so I could do stuff, but I didn't saw that until now. Then there is this boy(John) at her place, one of the best friends of her older brother. He stays at her place for 5 days out of 7 because he has issues with his parents. He became a friend of her family this was already for a year and half or even more I'm not sure. But I was struggling with the feeling that he had a better connection with Laura's family then that I had. I started asking me questions and started crying ""why am I such a closed person"" ""Why can't I just hug her mom when I need a hug"" ""I love them, why can't I show that"". My girlfriend caught me crying once when she left my place and came back inside because she had forgot something. She asked me what was going on and I just couldn't explain it threw all my emotions. I just held Laura in my arms when I was sad and it already would make me feel better, because even tho we have struggles she is still the woman that I love. After a week she started questioning why I didn't accept her family. And that even her mom was walking around with these questions, ""did she do something wrong?"" she even asked Laura if I think she's a bad mom. The thing is I do accept them but I could never manage to fully explain it nor could I show it. When I was at her place during the weekends when John was there also they were always joking about him flirting with Laura. I could laugh with it at the start I didn't really care since he had a girlfriend and he was never a match for me. After a while it just got annoying it was the only thing they could talk about when he was there. I was mad after a while and when she was riding me home she asked why I couldn't laugh with it. I told her it was just annoying and pathetic. And then for the first time I asked if she liked it? And she said she didn't care, I believed her.

She barely came over anymore and I felt I had to do effort to see her and I told her that. She said I never let her the chance to come to me because I always come to her. I told her that when she comes over she talks so much over John and she disagreed. I asked her if she would ever go with him? And she laughs and replies ""you're talking about John, he is like a brother for me"". Again I believed her and I let it go.

She went to school and in one week she told me someone had complimented her and that someone had pulled a chair out for her. And I became jealous, I became insecure, I had panic attacks when she wasn't there. I messaged her that I didn't want to be together anymore. I was thinking in my head that as soon as I would break up with her that she would go with someone else, because she doesn't love me anymore. I was wrong. She told me she would come over the next day and we talked, she made me calm again I said I regret that I broke up with you and we became back together. Here is the fucked up part, this process repeated itself another 2 times. Then she came over after a while not doing so, 2 days in a row, I was so happy. After I told her how much I loved her that she stayed with me. She then replied that she was forcing herself to look happy to make me happy. It hurt so much that I just didn't knew anything anymore. After a few days I panicked again and broke up for the 4th time. 2 Days after the break up she texted me and I didn't replied I was so mad and confused... She went out with her friends to a club close by and when she went out I replied on her message. She said that there was a ticket for the event left over so I could come. I told her that I'm coming and I took my bike and just when I left my place she asked me how I was coming, I told her by bike. Then she said that I shouldn't come then. So I went back inside, cried myself to sleep. 2 days later we talked on the phone and she said some boy brought her home. And he tried but she didn't do anything. We had a lot of fights for a week but saw each other barely in person. At one moment I said she was a bad girlfriend, she didn't do any effort for me. And that she just texted me that night so she didn't need a taxi home. This must have a hurt a lot... It's one of my biggest mistakes in life because I didn't mean any word of it. And I realise now that it again was a defensive mechanism, to not get hurt. But in the end I'm hurt because I've hurt the person I love the most on this planet. A few days passed and she came by my place. She told me she needed space and that John is there for her right now, because he understands how hard a relationship can be and he came out of it aswel with his girlfriend. I asked her if there was more between her and John? She replied: ""No, my mom also asked"", I know Laure very well and I could read on her face that she was lying. I said okay and let her leave...

I had so many questions, with no answers. Did she miss me? I was for 99% sure she had something with John, but I was thinking to myself that maybe I'm just making myself crazy...

I logged in on her messenger and saw that they were telling, that they love each other and even on one moment he was talking about hes penis that her reaction was so positive about it...They went to eat chicken nuggets just 3 days after we broke up in the middle of the night. Something that was our thing... I called her yesterday and asked if there is anything going on between her and John or something else or someone else. She said ""No and even it there would be something she wouldn't tell because she doesn't want to hurt me more"" I told her I loved her and that I saw the mistakes, I became close to begging her to stay with me, but she said she didn't wanne give me hope. I told her that I wanted to make her the happy Laura again with a smile on her face. Shen then replied 'I'm not sure you can still do that after everything that has happened""

I know I made so much mistakes. And I regret waiting for someone I truly love as my first relationship because otherwise I could have just learned like she did. I thought I could never lose her, now I did. I know he is not the one for her! I love her so much and I don't want to lose her. She is my everything. Should I give her time and space? Should I wait and hope her relationship bleeds out? I know I can make her the happiest girl alive, if I get another shot.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there, I first want to thank you for reading my story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it simple let&amp;#39;s call the girl: Laura&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy at her Place: John&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I was 14 I met this amazing girl in my class. And I fell in love. She also had emotions for me I could read it from her face. But I was a player back and she was with one of my friends. So we texted a lot but that&amp;#39;s it. A few years passed and I went to another school, we texted each other now and then for a short period of 1-2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

Have you loved someone so much that their smile can instantly turn your worst day ever into the best day ever?  Have you ever loved someone so much that when you see them your words don&amp;#39;t seem to come out right because you feel so incredibly happy to be with them and nothing else matters?  Have you ever held hands with someone and that alone made you feel complete, as if you had everything you were looking for your whole damn life was right there next to you?  Have you ever kissed someone that literally transformed your world and redefined what being in love was for you?  Have you ever had someone literally touch your soul and make you feel alive for the first time?&lt;/p&gt;

Have you had someone treat you like they no longer cared or even liked you?  Have you ever had someone&amp;#39;s lack of attention destroy you, leaving you with a huge hole in your chest?  Have you had someone leave you feeling empty inside?  Have you had someone crush your dreams and now the thought of them makes your eyes well up with tears?  Have you had someone who made it hard to breathe, like as if your chest was lined with shattered glass and with each breath, with each heartbeat shards of glass are sent through your heart?  Have you ever missed someone so terribly much that you&amp;#39;d do literally anything to take that pain away?  Have you ever missed someone so fucking much that you spend most of your day depressed wishing you could see them just one more time?&lt;/p&gt;

Dear crush,

Everyday when you walk into class I smile at you and you make eye contact and smile back. You have no idea that you instantly light up my day. I love the way your laugh fills the room and it's contagious. I appreciate that you notice when I'm not fine and you take action. You comfort me when I'm feeling sad and I know you always will be there for me. I love it when you call me by last name or just call me coordinator. It wasn't always this way. At the begining of this year we didn't talk very much mostly small talk and just admiring one another from afar. I don't remember who started the conversation but now it's been months and the talking never ends. We have grown close too close. I remember the trivia game we won and every time you I got a question right you would encourage me. My favorite memory is when we were listening to a presentation and I made a terrible joke and you fell off your stool from laughing so hard. I will never forget the time we were ""working"" in the hallway and that smirk you would give me when you were so curios and wanted info out of me. How you love nicknames but your gf hates them so we just call each other those dumb ass relationship nicknames and sometimes I even forget it's not real.  I have feelings for you. Everyday I started telling you but I could can say it. I never wanted to say because you have a girlfriend. She is pretty, sweet, and really smart. The fact that your always either texting, snap chatting, and dming each other all the time makes unbelievably jealous. I watch you smile when you open her texts and slightly tilt your phone away. I wish you talked about me the way you talk about her. When you ask for relationship advice I tell you what I wish you would say or do to me. Little do you know every time you ask tears roll down my face. Everyday when you choose to sit next to me and you press you thighs against mine the butterflies start. I wish you wouldn’t come sit next to me because it just makes all of this so much harder. I wish you would just leave me on opened and stop commenting on my instagram posts. I wish you would not talk or associate with me because then I could forget about you. I hate when I always say “you know you love me” and you reply “just a little” because I want you to say a lot and I want to mean it in a more then just friends way. I also know that you really just want to be friends I get it ""you value me and my friendship"" you appreciate the fact that I'm so graceful when It comes to the fact ""we aren't going to be together"". I respect it and I understand it guys don't want me. I just wanted you to know I love you so much more then friends. I love your messy hair, the way you bite your pen when you're thinking, how smart you are, and how you are so funny. I love everything about you captain.

i thought you could never like me back. what happened to that? i mean, i'm not complaining. but how the hell did this happen? you still make me feel special, but now i'm not just a best friend to you.

please keep staring back at me during class when i'm sad. please keep asking if i'm okay. please keep messaging me every few hours. i want to fall even more for you.

i still feel my heart drop when we can't talk. and we can't see each other unless we're in school. 

i still post lyrics to love songs and listen to too many love songs and you can thank yourself for that. 

i still try to be the happiest that i can for you. if i'm happy, i can usually make you feel better. if i'm happy, then you won't have to worry about me somehow dying.

dreams do come true, at least that's what it seems like now. 

just wait eleven more days and we'll have another chance to see each other. a chance to be together for hours *alone*. doesn't that sound great? we can hold hands, kiss, hug, cuddle, whatever you wish. anything for you.

Well, gotta say that I'm a hipocrite because when I miss my boyfriend I like to imagine us living together so I can come home to him every day.

We've only been in in a relationship for 8-ish months and I feel like I want to spend every day of my live with him. We're in college and he lives about four hours away so breaks are painful, and this summer has been the worst. Fortunately I visited him about two weeks in and I'm on the train now heading back and I feel heartbroken knowing I'm not going to see him for at least another month, probably two. 

I feel crazy because we haven't been in a relationship for very long and he is my very first boyfriend and I'm absolutely crazy about him. We even joke about getting married someday (very far from now. I am a sophomore in college so engagement by itself is at least three years away). He's the more romantic one too so it doesn't help when he says I'm his soulmate and he is totally in love with me.

Our college does gender inclusive housing and currently we are signed up to room together next year. I live in the town my college is in so I don't need to live on campus and I'm not sure I can afford it. The plan is that since I probably won't be able to afford it I'll wait till the last minute to switch my house status to commuter so he gets the room to himself for his last year of college so I reliably  have a place to stay when I need it and he doesn't have to live with a stranger his senior year.

If I can afford it I'm going to change my housing hopefully with the excuse that I am no longer comfortable with the gender inclusive option (I know a person I can probably room with). If that doesn't work out, I definitely have someone I can live with the second semester.

Not gonna lie though, a big part of me just wants to live with him since it's his last year. I know it's stupid. I think it's because I still have two years of college after he graduates and I'm afraid our relationship won't survive the distance, so I kinda want to go all in and just see what happens. I also want to make sure I can make the most of my last year with him. I think the fact that I have somewhere else to go if things go south is one of the reasons I'm ok with that.

Our friends think we're really stupid though and they won't let us forget it because they're actually pretty crappy friends. Another reason why I want to be with him all the time: he's the best friend I have in college.

The cabin was quiet and peaceful. Nath enjoyed being by himself. It was rare, so he relished in his quiet moments.

His naked body glistened with water and the soap bubbled on his chest. He rubbed a wet cloth over his skin, savouring the physical sensations. His pectoral muscles were very hard now, they formed hard rounded muscles on his chest. His shoulders were similarly hard and well defined. When he slipped the wash cloth down his stomach, he noticed that his abdominal muscles were also hard and rippling, forming ridges along his entire stomach area. He was pleased with the changes in his body. He felt very masculine. His birthday was not for another month, but he felt like a fully-grown man now. 

Even his genitals had grown, his penis, his pubic hair, it all looked very manly.

His penis twitched as he washed his genital area. 

He immediately thought of Anwa.

He couldn’t get her out of his thoughts. Every time he thought of a woman, it was Anwa that came to his mind. No one else. 

Soap bubbled on his scrotum and at the base of his penis. He watched his penis harden, as he rubbed and thought of Anwa. Her hair, her supple body and her smell. His hand rubbed higher, to the tip of his penis, then slid down, the soap providing excellent lubrication. Finally, he could take no more and sat on the bench, masturbating fully. He imagined Anwa sitting on top of his penis, right here in the middle of the room, both of them very naked and aroused. His hands ached to touch her naked buttocks and guide her vagina up and down on his penis. His mind floated to a sensual dream of a naked and aroused Anwa.

The spell broke when a sudden knocking thundered on his front door.

“Nath!” Viktor shouted outside of the door. “We need your help.”

“Leave me alone for a bit,” he responded grouchily. “I’m washing.”

“The plow broke again,” Viktor shouted through the door. “Come when you are done.”

“I will come when I am ready!” Nath shouted. “Go, get out of here. Do your best until I get there.”

Nath heard boots crunching into the snow, down the path, retreating from the cabin. *He never gets a moments peace around here, Nath thought.* He was beginning to get irritable. He would have to be more aware of his behaviour, keep his spirits up. Maybe he should go into Gimli next time and make an excuse to see Anwa.  

He closed his eyes briefly and imagined Anwa as his wife. How they could have frequent sex in the cabin, every morning or in the middle of the night, whenever they chose to. Her hair would flow underneath her as he mounted her and pushed himself inside her wetness. She would gasp similar to her groans when they kissed.

He opened his eyes and looked at the ceiling. He would need to talk to her again and kiss her again. He wasn’t sure how to progress things to sex, but he was beginning to think that he would want her as his wife. Maybe he should ask some of his cousins for advice. *No, he thought chuckling, they would be jeering him on every time Anwa was near him then.*     

He would have to just go with it and see what happens.

Nath pulled a dry pair of pants on and made his way to the door. He grabbed his boots and coat, then left the cabin to help with the snowplow. He looked back towards the empty cabin. *This could be their home together, he thought, as he stomped through the snow.*

He imagined Anwa sitting on top of his penis, right here in the middle of the room, both of them very naked and aroused. His hands ached to touch her naked buttocks and guide her vagina up and down on his penis. His mind floated to a sensual dream of a naked and aroused Anwa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spell broke when a sudden knocking thundered on his front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nath!” Viktor shouted outside of the door. “We need your help.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Leave me alone for a bit,” he responded grouchily. “I’m washing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The plow broke again,” Viktor shouted through the door. “Come when you are done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I will come when I am ready!” Nath shouted. “Go, get out of here. Do your best until I get there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nath heard boots crunching into the snow, down the path, retreating from the cabin. &lt;em&gt;He never gets a moments peace around here, Nath thought.&lt;/em&gt; He was beginning to get irritable. He would have to be more aware of his behaviour, keep his spirits up. Maybe he should go into Gimli next time and make an excuse to see Anwa.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He closed his eyes briefly and imagined Anwa as his wife. How they could have frequent sex in the cabin, every morning or in the middle of the night, whenever they chose to. Her hair would flow underneath her as he mounted her and pushed himself inside her wetness. She would gasp similar to her groans when they kissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He opened his eyes and looked at the ceiling. He would need to talk to her again and kiss her again. He wasn’t sure how to progress things to sex, but he was beginning to think that he would want her as his wife. Maybe he should ask some of his cousins for advice. &lt;em&gt;No, he thought chuckling, they would be jeering him on every time Anwa was near him then.&lt;/em&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would have to just go with it and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nath pulled a dry pair of pants on and made his way to the door. He grabbed his boots and coat, then left the cabin to help with the snowplow. He looked back towards the empty cabin. &lt;em&gt;This could be their home together, he thought, as he stomped through the snow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an inspirational author that believes in love, soulmates and that things happen for many reasons beyond what we understand. Please follow me on my journey completing this amazing novel. I will be posting weekly, every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

I am finished with loving you and waiting for you to love me. 

I have loved you from the very start. We were 12 years old, you walked in the room with your black and white jacket and messy black hair, glasses too small for your face. You stole my copy of the Hobbit and made me chase you around the room for it. You weren’t the best at flirting.

I wrote my first complete song about you. It was the day after you chose to cut me out of your life at age 15. No goodbye. No reason. You went on an angry rampage about something I said and blocked me all over and ignored me. So I wrote you a love song. It was written on the piano I taught you Für Elise on. 

You came back because our favorite band came on the radio and it made you think of me for the first time in 3 years; you still knew every word. Your girlfriend had never even heard of them. We didn’t talk very often. 

You called me when your 4-year-long relationship ended. We hadn’t talked in months. I was there in 20 minutes with smoothies and good music. We went on a hike and sat on those swings we used to love so much. You told me you wished you’d chosen to love me before all of this. I told you that would have been nice. 

You got back on your feet, and I moved to college. You called me once, drunk, to tell me you loved me and always have. I told you to go to sleep. You told me you’d never find anyone so loving and kind. I hung up the phone. 

You disappeared again, and I moved on again. You still call every once in a while, you’re usually drunk or in a panic. You always tell me I’m the best at calming you down because you feel calmest around me. But I feel panicked around you.

I have loved you. I have loved you for so long, with no need for you to love me back. In fact, I know you would never love me back. 

So I am finished waiting. I am finished loving you. And I will probably never love anyone else the way I have loved you. But at least they will love me too.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

From complexion to her smile. Although I am a bit picky I'm especially picky with how she how she corresponds to the world. She is to stand out in ways others wouldn't understand.

Her makeup should be restricted to an eyeliner and lipstick only. Another area when I’m a bit picky.

Her smile is her most powerful weapon. Her smile holds the power to soothe a troubled man’s heart.

She should wear traditional clothing once in a while. There is a certain beauty in a girl which comes to light when she wears traditional clothing.

She shouldn’t be afraid of coming in front of a camera. She better not be. There are photography ideas I want to try on the one.

She shouldn’t be afraid of saying things like “I’m fat” or “my butt looks weird”. She shouldn’t be afraid of body shaming herself. I somehow find that adorable when a girl herself says these things. I guess I like it when a girl knows who she is. (I’ll come back to this point later.)

She better be argumentative. If she is right, she better know to prove it. She better be fierce in her arguments. Not the shouting kind, but someone who puts forth valid arguments.

She better keep secrets. Her secrets. There will be stuff about her life that she doesn’t share with anyone. She need not share that stuff with me too. Actually, I’d prefer if she didn’t share secrets. Same is the case with me, I’ll keep my secrets with me. 
People say they should know everything about the person they’re with. I think otherwise. I think keeping secrets is important. There will be aspects of a person's life where it’s better that their partners are not involved.

Creativity would be a trait I like. Of any kind. Preferably poetic.

Regardless of how mature she is, there is a little child inside her. Who she embraces when she is happy. Who dances in her eyes (figuratively) when she dances with joy, or when she's genuinely happy. She embraces this child and lets it know that it is loved.

We are not perfect. I’m not, she won’t be either. But we can make it work. Her imperfections would only be a reminder that she is human. So am I.

She’s someone you can come home to. Whose face can light up your day when you feel down. Who hears you out. Who gives you advice. Who completes you in places where you are incomplete.

I think these traits might belong to the perfect one. Other traits that come would be cool.

There is magic in the way she speaks. Magic in the way she triwls her hair. Beauty in the say she where her heart. She charms me in a heartbeat. Then, those eyes, it gets me everytime.

She is someone you come home to. completes you in ways you do not understand. You feel alive. Give your life purpose in a sense.

She is the world where you belong. She is your sweet escape. She feels like home.

I asked him out, in a moment of being taken over by the whim of it. This was before we had the chance to establish our friendship, and before I gave myself more fully to understanding why him. He said no. And i dropped it for as long as I could which I think was about a month. And then it came back. It causes me to realize more the intensity that’s there.

So how do I(20 female) know if i'm in love or just want to be closer friends to someone?

He's a istp (19 male) that we are close friends even though we don't talk much.I think its due to working together in school projects most of the time and i did ask him face on if we are close friends. I've known him for 3 years but deep inside,i know i'm not really that close to him since i don't know anything about him outside from the time i meet him in school.Usually this doesn't bother me with friends since i'm not sure if i want to keep this bond between him alive after graduation(I've only have 2 friends which was kept with low effort since they live far from me and they are usually busy so we don't do meetups like at all but we do keep in contact a few times per few months and it doesn't feel like we have grown apart so far)

But...

Nowadays,i had this want to keep this strong friendship even after graduation and it doesn't help that i have 3 separate dreams where i was chatting real excited like an extrovert to him alone and the feeling was always warm and fluffy like although i don't feel lust towards him.I frequently check my ig story and see if he did saw my story and each time he saw my story or liked my post,i would feel slightly happier than my other friends since its like he noticed me in a way.(I dont usually feel this way when my other friends liked or saw my post) I've also felt embarrassed when talking about romance with him alone vs me being confused by people's dumb action when 'in love' with other friends in a group.I also just had this want to know more about him in terms of how he thinks,how he see the world etc just recently and am giving some of my time within reasons to hang out with him and if possible alone so that i can ask more personal questions and know him more face to face.I find it hard to hang out or talk to people without a purpose so this is a first for me to ask personal questions and trying to find reasons to see him face to face and talk to him more.I find myself jealous or sad when he talks and have more physical contact to his other male friends more compared when he talks to me sometimes because i want to be that guy when he talk cause he feel more in his comfort zone than when talking to me.I also like the sound of his voice,i do think he's cute although i don't strongly feel those warm fluffy feeling that i have when i'm in love with a franchise or book.But sometimes i had this feeling of just holding his hand,hugging,being in close contact with him and even kissing him like what couples do although there's no lust feeling whatsoever since i'm bored of porn(its like watching animal zoo tbh)

What i want from him is not a couple status although i do think its nice but i want him to feel that i am trust-able to the point where he's isn't afraid to talk to me because of his own fear,society or self expectation etc and i'll like to do the same for him. I've also come to my own conclusion and is sure that he's an istp(even though i didn't ask him to do the mbti quiz since i want to know more about him first hand) and done some reading on how to catch his interest,talk longer,predicting what he like and putting it into action.

I'm so confused even though i do read what being in love is like but it just doesn't feel right.Mainly because i don't feel lust towards him but i want him to accept who i really am when i do expose my inner self and i want to do the same for him.

&lt;p&gt;Its been about three weeks since i left. Its been about three months sit you decided i was no longer worth trying for. You have no idea how much i miss your hugs, and i hope you never know. People ask me if i loved you. Is eight months enough time to fall in love?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You didnt want to be friends and thats okay. I cant force you, i dont want to. When i first saw you, when i realised who you were and why i kept staring at you, i knew that no matter what happened your happiness was a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much. For everything you did for me. I love you, even if eight months isnt enough time.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m doing most of the moderating myself at the moment and as i’m from the U.K I think it would be great if someone from the other side of the world could help us out (U.S, Australia, NZ, India or any country with a reasonable time difference).

I have an irrational obsession for a girl I've never met. Every day, I think about her and an imaginary reality where we are together.  I also think about how I was an idiot for never approaching her, but also doubting she would have ever went out with me.

I originally saw her my 2nd year at college after coming out of my geology class. We locked eyes and she smiled; I thought about approaching her the next time I saw her. I saw her about another 2 or 3 times but I failed to muster up the courage to talk to her. At a certain point I stopped seeing her and stopped caring, but I always wished I would see her again on campus. 

This past year, my 3rd year, I saw her at one of our football games, she was with a guy but I was still ecstatic that I saw her. 

Fast forward to spring semester, I see her towards the end of the semester after having lunch at the student union which I usually dont visit. Out of curiosity, I went back the next week and saw her again. This went on another 2 or 3 times, always losing the opportunity to approach her (excuses and bad situations). Didnt see her much more after that and I stopped going out of my way to try and see her.

I don't even know this girls name or anything about her other than that I am unusually attracted to her and I beat myself up for never approaching her.

I dont necessarily believe in soul mates, but I've never felt this way towards a girl in passing by. I've see plenty of beautiful girls on campus, not knowing anything about them, but I've never been hung up on something like this. Maybe it's missed opportunity, but I've felt this way the first day I looked into her eyes.

The only explanation I have is that we are generically compatible and I unconsciously realize it, so my brain paints a reality that doesnt exist so that one day I might ask her out.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Seems weird I have such a metaphysical connection to someone I've never met.

He ended up coming over and we just talked for like 5 hours until the sun came up.  It was so magical. After that we hung out all the time and ended up tripping together. Which was also so fucking beautiful. It had felt like I’d known him my whole life ?? Things got distant when my school started and we didn’t talk much. That didn’t mean I didn’t think of him every day though, it was torture. We reconnected recently and it’s like nothing changed. He still makes me feel things and no body makes me feel things. I know we both know about this insane connection , and I know we both love each other. It’s just right person wrong time, which sucks. He makes me want to create and be the best version of myself I could be. He feels like home and it hurts so bad. When I’m with him it’s like I’m with me. I’ve just never felt sum like this and it is scary yet beautiful all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

I miss spending our weekends where I would sleep in and you would lay in bed awake waiting for me to wake up so we could make breakfast together. No matter how hungry you were, you’d always wait and kiss me once I did. We’d blast music and dance around as we made food together. You always made something sweet, I always made the savory. It’s the little things....

We had a bumpy relationship because of poor timing. You were fresh out of relationship that hurt you, I was still new to the relationship world and wanted something quick and fast. Looking back, I’m so beyond thankful to have met you. You’ve literally changed my life and showed me I’m capable of being loved, that I’m a wonderful woman who deserves everything and more. You’ve made me a much more confident person who’s a lot happier and doesn’t feel so ugly or rejected. You’ve made me even more open and accepting of everything. For that, I’m beyond thankful for you. 

I hope one day we reconnect because i truly believe you are the love of my life. I waited so long for you and there you were. I had you and I loved you. I hope we find each other again and we start a life together. I hope you realize sooner rather than later that we were good together. We never had problems. We never fought, we just loved our life together. We enjoyed each other. We loved hard. We could still be a powerful couple. You, the computer scientist, me, the doctor. Our kids would be *fucking* awesome. Those little shits would have the best personalities and would grow up with a diverse range of music. 

Just know I miss you. I love you. I want you. I want you to move back to me (or me to you). I wish we would talk more but I’m sorry if I ruined that. But I still hold onto hope....

Take care my love.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven’t stopped thinking about you since the day you left and moved back home to NY almost 6 months ago, but it’s getting painful to realize that some memories are starting to fade. I’m forgetting the small details of your face, I’m forgetting your voice and the weird habits you had. But I’ll never forget your laugh and your kind eyes.

There’s a certain sense of beauty about her. It’s not something you’d find written in a Hallmark card nor cleverly tucked away in an old Japanese haiku dating hundreds of years ago. No this is something that you have to had truly been in the moment to realize and let it sit for a while. Letting it sit to age like a wine, even though I’m no wine connoisseur, but it gets better with time.

I look at her everyday she’s here and miss her everyday she’s not but I allow myself space and give her the much needed break from me. I don’t need to suffocate someone when nothing is said in stone. My mental and physical health have been staggering for the last months into years so maybe that’s all getting to me in an emotional way. I want to be better than I am now but I can’t, thanks to kidney failure, but I try to keep my head up and let the crying nights and splitting headaches, and random nausea be only a momentary lapse in my male “machismo.” She’s wonderful and great and I’m only less than that at the moment and that prevents me from moving forward to say what I want to say and be what I’d like us to be. 

We’re great friends sprouted from literally nowhere and in only months time, we’ve grown closer, I’d like to think. We share the same but never forced my male fantasies on her; I wash her clothes and dry as if it were my own with the same attention; I sleep with the comforting feeling that I am not alone and while she may be restless at night sometimes, with the accidental hitting, I don’t mind at all. I sleep like a rock and even later than usual. I hope that she’s comfortable being here with me, but not “with” me. 

Physically she is a goddess, mentally she’s a little difficult to figure out but that’s not why I’m here. She’s well rounded in a way that I cannot explain not care to. She has beautiful hair which she thinks is too short; her figure is incredibly built, and small details that follow are just the cherries on top. She’s got gorgeous eyes that seem to stare at you and through you; her lips are always soft, at least they look soft, her fingers are beautiful little appendages, and her smile is amazing. Cliché? Sure but what is not admiring if it doesn’t sound like a cheap Valentine’s Day card minus the chocolate? 

She may think I’m a nerd, I definitely am but that’s the glory of me. I’m being me with and without her, she knows only the true me 100% of the time. And I hope she can see and respect that. Sure, I’m still a guy with urges but they don’t define my feelings towards her. Does it make me different, maybe maybe not? She just needs to know that I’d treat her as if she were glass and keep her safe if I could. She’s absolutely amazing and I love it. Once, she mentioned how our ex’s are usually opposites of the previous ones and that’s kind of true, not that we’re dating, but she’s the opposite of my ex and I’m sure I’m the opposite of hers but who knows. I just wanted to let it be known that she is literally the most wonderful person that I’ve been lucky to have in my life in a long time.

Can you love someone that doesn’t have feelings for you back?

Is love a material, surface level, or vanity feeling?  Or is it something that can only exist with a deep connection between two individuals, that flows both ways?  Can love be one sided?

Can you love someone that doesn’t give you pleasure? If so, how?

If you think you love someone who doesn’t have feelings for you then what do you actually love about them?  If you know someone doesn’t love you, who you say you love — then does knowing they don’t hold you to the highest level (love) as you hold them erode your attraction to them? And if it doesn’t, then what is it you are still attracted to about them? This form of love to me seems surface level.

For example, if you think you love someone that is in a relationship with another person they love, then what do you actually love about them? It would seem to me that love only exists when a connection is formed, and for the connection to form I believe the other party needs to have some feeling of attraction to the first person in order to create true happiness and a shared connection.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Thoughts/Questions on Love...&lt;/p&gt;

So we met way back on November 9th, 2017 at a bar of all places lol... I remember your beer and sitting in your lap drunk pressed against your gun and even tho I dont remember everything that was said I'll never forget your blue eyes and looking back I wish I would have let you take me home ik you just wanted me to get home safe ....


Fast forward to that Sunday I knew I absolutely needed to see you again..... but one thing I dont think you realized at the time even tho that night as we lied in bed together in each others arms so drunk  I was emotional thinking of how broken I was and a mess and just got out of an engagement 3 months prior and still hurting and i told you and as tears ran down my face you looked at me with those big blue eyes and said you didn't care that i was a mess or any of the other things i said that night but that you wanted me i think you just knew from that moment i was your one ... and i was hooked on the way we fit together so perfectly and you would slide your hand down my back as you pulled me so close and you would always so ""absolutely"" to everything because you just knew absolutely knew even then... I think a part of me knew as well but I was fucking terrified ! If it wasn't for your friends I probably wouldnt have stayed I didn't feel like I deserved you.. this love that wrapped around me and all the million pieces you found me in..... but I'm so happy I did because every night you wanted me there to the point I just never left and each night I couldn't help but in the moment start to feel happy .. I didn't need the weed or the drugs to feel high you were it and as time went on this love that wrapped around me started to form the glue that was sticking the pieces back together!

Now fast forward to January 2 2018 it had been a week and a half already since I missed my period and I just knew I was pregnant and terrified that this was it .... and as I saw the words pregnant pop up on the screen I couldn't even bring myself to tell you in person but I had to send a pic and yk what you said it's ok babe you knew we'd be ok and it was... and yk what our son ended up being a blessing in disguise he changed our whole life and honestly there was never a moment I felt alone or had to face anything by myself ! And in the end i gained 3 things our son, and amazing new family, and this new self that I couldn't be more proud of !




There are a lot of people that want finished projects,  basically excepting perfection or damn near it out of there partners  ... which I dont understand because we all have problems and issues some just are way better at hiding them... and yk they say that true love meets you in your mess and that was true this amazing blue eyed red haired man met this woman who was a mess and falling a part and emotionally unavailable and all he saw was her smile that lite up the room and the way her eyes looked all the way through him when she saw him and the little weird quirks and habits she had formed over the years and fell in love with the light he saw hidden behind all the ways she had spent years building up ! And he never once tried to fix her he just loved her instead and that's really all she needed to start to heal ! And honestly I couldn't be more grateful for this amazing man he is everything good in my life and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him and expand our little family ❤","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off I just wanna say ik you will probably never see this but I need to put this into words somewhere so here it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to that Sunday I knew I absolutely needed to see you again..... but one thing I dont think you realized at the time even tho that night as we lied in bed together in each others arms so drunk  I was emotional thinking of how broken I was and a mess and just got out of an engagement 3 months prior and still hurting and i told you and as tears ran down my face you looked at me with those big blue eyes and said you didn&amp;#39;t care that i was a mess or any of the other things i said that night but that you wanted me i think you just knew from that moment i was your one ... and i was hooked on the way we fit together so perfectly and you would slide your hand down my back as you pulled me so close and you would always so &amp;quot;absolutely&amp;quot; to everything because you just knew absolutely knew even then... I think a part of me knew as well but I was fucking terrified ! If it wasn&amp;#39;t for your friends I probably wouldnt have stayed I didn&amp;#39;t feel like I deserved you.. this love that wrapped around me and all the million pieces you found me in..... but I&amp;#39;m so happy I did because every night you wanted me there to the point I just never left and each night I couldn&amp;#39;t help but in the moment start to feel happy .. I didn&amp;#39;t need the weed or the drugs to feel high you were it and as time went on this love that wrapped around me started to form the glue that was sticking the pieces back together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now fast forward to January 2 2018 it had been a week and a half already since I missed my period and I just knew I was pregnant and terrified that this was it .... and as I saw the words pregnant pop up on the screen I couldn&amp;#39;t even bring myself to tell you in person but I had to send a pic and yk what you said it&amp;#39;s ok babe you knew we&amp;#39;d be ok and it was... and yk what our son ended up being a blessing in disguise he changed our whole life and honestly there was never a moment I felt alone or had to face anything by myself ! And in the end i gained 3 things our son, and amazing new family, and this new self that I couldn&amp;#39;t be more proud of !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people that want finished projects,  basically excepting perfection or damn near it out of there partners  ... which I dont understand because we all have problems and issues some just are way better at hiding them... and yk they say that true love meets you in your mess and that was true this amazing blue eyed red haired man met this woman who was a mess and falling a part and emotionally unavailable and all he saw was her smile that lite up the room and the way her eyes looked all the way through him when she saw him and the little weird quirks and habits she had formed over the years and fell in love with the light he saw hidden behind all the ways she had spent years building up ! And he never once tried to fix her he just loved her instead and that&amp;#39;s really all she needed to start to heal ! And honestly I couldn&amp;#39;t be more grateful for this amazing man he is everything good in my life and I can&amp;#39;t wait to spend the rest of my life with him and expand our little family ❤&lt;/p&gt;

Hell, I don't even know if this subreddit allows it, I don't know where to express myself and It's starting to really build up.

&amp;#x200B;

I  have observed and experienced throughout my life (22 y/o) the growth of  several ideas. That relationships have to be temporary, that the  concept of ""love for life"" is  repressive and frowned upon, that  sexuality comes before love, that people should always put their own  interests first, that you need to ""leave people and let them work their  problems out"" instead of caring enough to really help them work it  through.

&amp;#x200B;

I  keep seeing those ideas drilling through so many relationships  everywhere I turn to look, it makes me feel enraged and philosophically  alone.

&amp;#x200B;

It  seems to me like this is an amalgamation of terrible ideas, linked to a  fear of commitment and responsibility, aswell as an excessive  encouragement to put self-sufficiency, pleasure, desire and ""freedom"" as  the paramount value on which you should base your behaviors, and I am  deeply convinced that this is the basis on which an outstanding amount  of emotional and human misery is built. We struggle to balance ideas of  progress and the reality of our feelings, emotions, hopes, frustrations  and conflicted desires.

&amp;#x200B;

Love  and relationships are absurdly powerful and incredibly important in the  lives of almost anyone, they shape the way we see and experience the  world, and I truly believe that we are making terrible mistakes in the  way we approach them, and the way we try to make them evolve in our  culture. Untrustworthy and brittle relationships don't make for happy  people, and unhappy people doesn't make for a healthy society.

&amp;#x200B;

I  might not have expressed myself correctly, and I definitely am not  being exhaustive in the way I feel about this, I'm just ranting and I  don't even know what I'm excepting of this post.

&amp;#x200B;

The  worst thing is, these are not fatalities, these are choices and ideas  we decide to put forth. It makes me feel sad to see so much misery  coming from this, and I don't see my ideas carried anywhere by anyone,  and it makes me feel alone for some reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe  I'm getting some things wrong, but I'm not turning a blind eye to the  world an imagining things, these are rock hard concrete and consistent  things I see. And again, maybe I'm wrong, but I can never have a  discussion about those things with anyone, people get offended over this  shit and never bring up what they actually think or slightly discuss  the ideas I'm trying to put on the table.

I’m showing the letter I wrote to the special girl. Writing this letter made me realize that I truly do love her. 

Here it is:

You deserve to know how special of a person you are, wholeheartedly disclosed, as well as my best effort in conveying my feelings for you. I want you to feel as comfortable as possible, while still getting my feelings across - I’ll call them feelings at least. It’s crazy to think you’re still the same girl in 4th grade that caught my attention for the first time in a distant memory. I would catch myself getting nervous when you were around, experiencing the feeling of butterflies in stomach, and embarrassment to act normal. And then in 5th grade I was so flustered when you were told that I like you. A faint feeling still persisted that I begun dismissing later on, until more recently I discovered new, enduring feelings for a special girl; feelings that move me. It took a better me to be able to learn how to deal with and acknowledge the need to express my feelings. I have anxiety that keeps me from expressing myself: the anxieties of reflecting on mistakes, overthinking, and not reaching for what I care about. Sometimes it’s hard not to look at everything through a hopeless, despairing lens. I procrastinated expressing my feelings for you; thinking about doing things and not actually doing them, something we’re probably both very skilled at. Now I can let you know how wonderful of a person you are and how much you mean to me. No words can adequately illustrate the way you make me feel about you. It’s things like the sound of your voice, hearing you laugh, seeing your lovely face, your eyes, your long, gorgeous blonde hair, how giftedly smart and talented you are, your vibrant personality, your likability, and your kindness. You’re someone special to be around, even for as short as we see each other. It’s a beautiful feeling to want to be closer with you. You give me affectionate and uplifting feelings I would never want taken away. You’ve always been so kind and friendly around people, including me. It’s something that makes me ruminate on why it’s my fault for not being around you more, but now I can spell out my intentions. It would do a disservice to us both if I hid my feelings for how special you are to me, especially with all the bullcrap we each have had to go through and all the stupid things you’ve seen me do. You deserve to know how amazing you are. You’re as beautiful as the alluring sunset we could watch together, even for as cheesy as that sounds. I reached a point where I prayed to God for how to handle having these feelings and I also prayed for you. It feels so much better exposing myself to you and it needs to be done properly in person, where I can truly be myself. I didn’t know what exactly or how much to tell you at once, but you deserve to know a vulnerable side of me at least. I figured now would be opportune to confess my feelings before I die from AP testing, and of course since our time at ... is nearing an end. But most importantly because I learned how to appreciate you and have the confidence in expressing how special you are to me. Because I care about you, I want to know how you feel, however way it is comfortable for you. Tell me anything you want however you want, and take as long as you need; you don’t owe me any reciprocity. You can contact me with my # ... if you want. Obviously it’s a little too late to ask you to go to prom with me, I should’ve asked a while ago. I wanted to express myself to you because I want to spend time with a special woman who deserves to be treated as special. Any negatives you may bring is still worth maintaining these feelings for you. You’re worth getting to know, you’re worth the compassionate sacrifices and careful attention that you may need without being detrimental to myself. I’ll still be able to respect and take care of myself as well as others. There are boundaries and personal space that are vital. Sometimes you just need the thought of that one person to motivate yourself. Because you are you, you are “her” to me. You are her that I can talk about anything with, be a companion with, be patient with, share joy with, bitterly argue with, and care with. You are her to me because you are special to me. You are her, Elizabeth.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m showing the letter I wrote to the special girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I start, a bit about me and my sexuality; I'm in my mid 20's, probably bi (trying to figure out), Grew up in a really christian strict family and a society where being anything else than a masculine jerk is considered unacceptable, so you know, I have a lot of emotions and personality traits buried deep down that it actually turned me into a masculine dude who doesn't know what he's attracted to (or just doesn't accept the reality).

I've had relationships both with men and women (sex included), and to be completely honest, they're almost equal to me. I feel like i'm more connected on an emotional level to women but sexually to men ? or maybe not, idk.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, now to the story. When I moved here, a former friend of mine who I'm really close to introduced me to his friends, one of who is the guy that i'm going to talk about (let's call him Jake just for the sake of it). Jake is the most straightest and masculine person you would ever meet. Our friendship was below average at the beginning, not talked to much, never went deep into each others personal lives and etc. We only hung around with 2 of our other friends, never alone but kinda went along better than our other 2 friends. I've noticed some stuff about him (stuff that questions his masculinity) but never took it seriously because I personally was not interested in him AT ALL, never thought or looked at him that way. A year passes by, I go on one month vacation and that's when I realized I am in deep sh\*t. I realized that my life is missing something but struggled to figure out what until I came back from my vacation and saw Jake for the first time. It's like my subconscious was falling for him a bit by bit. I felt connected to him, his presence game me comfort, just thinking of him was equally peaceful and depressing. Peaceful because you know, love and etc and depressing because whatever I was feeling can never result in anything good. I can never end up with him even tho lets say he came out or opened up to me, It just feels wrong for me to be with another dude although he's the only thing that matters and the only thing that I can think of (yes, I fell for him REALLY badly). 

Some examples of what he did that made me question if there is really a connection between us; I've noticed that I tend to touch someone a lot when they're the only thing that I think of, it's like uncontrollable, you accidentally touch them while talking or laughing but was that really an accident? don't think so. He would do the same but more. He calls me almost everyday, even though there is no reason to call. The touching get would get severe especially while drunk (I came up with a theory that alcohol kind of put his guard down, somehow his subconscious was taking more control? idk.) He would always want me to drop off my other friends first so me and him can talk in the car alone for hours. He was overly concerned about what I do with other people and in my regular daily life.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to let my guard down and be free with him at least, to get to a conclusion, but never got anywhere. He started asking about my sexuality a lot lately, but I've been denying that question myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had similar situations before but not like this, I have been attracted to a friend or someone I know that I cannot end up with, but dealt with it easily, just convinced my self that this is just a waste of time.

This time tho, this time was different because I felt a repulsive connection from him too.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been exactly a year since I went on my vacation, which means I've been feeling this peace and torture for almost a year now. I'm getting nowhere. I tried to forget about him but the only way to do this is to stay away from him (which I did for a month but that just killed both of us, it was devastating).

&amp;#x200B;

I know the smallest details about him, I can tell you about him more than he can about himself. I paid attention to details without realizing it. I fell for him, really badly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to move on, But this time, and only this time, I feel like this connection is to good to just go to waste. I kinda feel like he's dealing with this too, just not on my level (I'm kinda more open minded about sexuality that it's ok for me to acknowledge some of these stuff). I can sometimes see his pain too, his confusion and his emotions. I feel like we're both stuck in a place that is divided with a really thin line that we cannot cross, at least not in this dimension.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now currently getting really into subconscious studies, dreams, emotions, and it;s helping me to understand a bit more. But yet again, this is not taking me anywhere. I see him every single day, i go though this every day, i wake up thinking about him and feeling like shit. I feel like i'm wasting time but I still don't want to give up. I just don't want to give up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jake would most probably turn into another memory buried deep down, but I know for a fact, that the past year has been my best and worst year. I'm going on another one month vacation to the same place in a week. I don't know whats going to happen but the ride was hela crazy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know how I got to this point, that i&amp;#39;m actually writing a Reddit post (I&amp;#39;ve been an observer for my entire life) but i feel like this is something that I want to get it off my chest since i have no one to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (26F) have experienced alot of unsavory relationships, struggling with the termonology of love &amp;amp; the feeling itself was foriegn to me for a long time, until i met my boyfriend (24M) over the last 6 months, he has shown me so much about love, the feeling itself and the generosity of someone who loves with no motives or minipulation behind it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hit me so hard tonight as i crawled underneath my heated throw blanket, that he genuienly loves me and i genuienly love him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im excited for our future, it really is the small things that add up.&lt;/p&gt;

Victoria started as a hopeless crush when I was a sophomore in high school.

Here's a story that i've told few people, I think telling it helps me see how lucky I am, and soothes my itch for creative writing.

&amp;#x200B;

We were both auditioning for an amateur production of a musical. Honestly? She didn't sing that well, but damn if I didn't hang on to every sound that escaped her lips like as if my life depended on it. I had my heart broken before, and I wasn't looking for any kind of relationship to start, especially one that wouldn't or couldn't last. But when she approached me for the first time, something was different. This creature was different from everyone else. The aura she emitted was very different than mine; kind, selfless, and loving. She greets me with a smile and a hug.

Some background. I went to a private all guys school for both middle and high school. My class is very unified. No one was ever bullied, I always had someone to rely on, and the friends I met there will be close to me for life. Throughout 8th and 9th grade, I had tried my luck with another girl. I think I tricked myself into falling in 'love'. I put quotation marks because I don't think that it was true love. I began to believe the lies I told myself about her. Anyways, long story short, I asked her out and she dropped me like a sack of potatoes. Unfortunately, I have a knack for over-thinking, so it hit me hard. So, naturally, despite the support from my class and generally being emotionally spoiled, I fall into a depression. I start cutting off friends, getting into bad habits, and becoming a very rude, toxic, negative individual. It's at this point where I am walking towards the bottom of the downwards spiral, if you catch my drift.

So, a hug is nice. A friend of ours introduces us to each other, and we go from there. We are both casted as minor/background characters. No big deal. As we begin to meet up for rehearsals, however, being a minor role reveals itself as a blessing. The lead girl ~~was a real bitch~~ seemed difficult to work with, and the director demanded a lot from the star roles. On top of that, there was no need to sit and memorize lines and such with how little our roles were. So, we had some time to ourselves. I believe it is this time that allowed me to fall for her.

It is very hard to explain with words, but Victoria gives off an energy, a vibe, filled with positivity and peace. I remember once that she overheard another girl talking shit about her behind her back, and simply told us that she hope that she can fix whatever made them upset. Like what? Anyone else I know would at least tell them to back off. I find that it takes an extraordinary amount of love to not simply forgive, but sincerely hope the best for a stranger who has wronged you. Even without its contents, her voice produces the same effect. It is so uplifting, I feel as if she's always cheering for me somehow. It's rhythm, it's flow, it is just so appealing. It's the same with her eyes. My Lord, her eyes. The same eyes I dream of at night, that I long to be staring at when I wake up. And yet, no word, no phrase that I know of can accurately portray them. Hazel colored and almond shaped, that twinkle in any form of light. Every time her gaze flickers in my direction I feel as if i've been shot, and it takes all the willpower I can muster to resist dropping dead or staring. 

I hated it. My mind was still fresh with my past experience and I was not over it. There was a point where I was actively avoiding Victoria to try to get rid of these feelings. I told myself not to get invested. That these feelings were just more lies that I tell myself so I can try to be happier, and only end up terrorizing my heart. Besides, she had a boyfriend. And even better, he goes to my school. Even if I has the gusto, the gall, the confidence to tell her how I felt, would I really want to do that to one of my friends?

But the heart has a way of pushing back when the mind start to pull away. I do little things, like paying close attention when she speaks, letting every word sink in and understanding it, smiling whenever she draws near, hugging for slightly longer every time we greet. In the musical, there was a point where we interacted with each other for a brief moment. It became my favorite part of the show. Each time we did it I would stare directly into her eyes. It was supposed to be a tense moment, so it fit into character. Or at least, that was the excuse I used. 

Even when she wasn't around, she became a part of everything I do. I clearly remember a time where she was on my mind at all times. I dream of her at night when I sleep, when I wake up, when I brush my teeth, when i'm making coffee, etc. In a way, I started to imitate her. I think, *What would Victoria do in this situation?*, and things like that.

This is the reason I am so lucky to know her. In a strange way, this borderline obsession I had with her helped me transform into a better person. I thought of her as an angel, an angel that I try to replicate. She would always go out of her way to make people happy, be so kind and forgiving, and always be happy and radiant. I mirrored it, and in return, became a happier person myself. She dragged me out of the negative state I was in.

In a similar vein, she also impacted my faith. I don't like to talk about religion, but Victoria is an ardent Catholic. When the show was on its feet and ready to present, she gathered the whole cast and crew before every performance and prayed with us. I have never, ever, seen someone so passionate about a religion as she is. She would always thank God for the opportunity to meet each and every one of us first and foremost. I had never been into practicing faith and such.

Back on track, towards the end of the show, there was some pretty big drama. Apparently, she found out that her boyfriend was cheating on her with one of the choir girls. Bombshell. She kept her emotion under wraps, and they split up quietly. I only found out about it after the musical was over. And now, she's single, and with the show over, I couldn't see her almost every day like I used to. Everything seemed to have happened so quickly. 

It was about half a year later when I saw her again. I hated the fact that I could not get over her. Even through an action-packed summer, she was always there, somewhere, in the back of my mind. Any time I was alone too long, my thoughts would drift towards the same place. I was already reaping the benefits of knowing her, however. Once again I became social, and had a newfound motivation to keep on keeping on. I even picked up my grades towards the end of the school year.

Once again, I went to audition for an ametuar musical, and guess who shows up? Needless to say, Victoria and I had a lot to catch up on. I have a personal journal (it's not a diary!) entry about how much I told her, and yet failed to express how I really felt. She did a complete 180 from breaking up and took it like a champ. My mind also got a reminder of how hopeless I am, and how much I owed to her. It was like a slap to the face with the most beautiful flowers you've ever seen. We were both invited to callbacks the day after. I remember her being very nervous. In fact, after her callback audition, I saw her sitting on a bench outside, looking like a sad little puppy. 

As you can probably tell by now, i'm not the most ballsy guy. If I was watching a movie about my life, I would have shouted ""Just ask her out already!"" a billion times by now. So, completely out of character, I sit next to her and ask her to pray with me. I still wasn't religious at all, but seeing her sad like that wretched my heart in an ugly and disgusting way. Everything she told me and everyone else when they were down crept back up to me. I think it really helped her out, and it felt really good to do so. I didn't see much else of her that night, but she texted me the next day saying how much she appreciated the gesture. To this day, I go back and read that text when i'm not feeling so good about myself. 

Victoria didn't get casted. I got one of the lead roles, and had plenty of lines and blocking to practice. But I decided to not lose connection with her again. We had a group in common to hang out with, and we made plans pretty often. I never asked her out separately. I didn't want to overstep my boundaries. And I figured that she deserves someone better than me. It is a mentality that I will always regret having. 

Despite this, the dreams and thoughts never faded away. She's always a part of me and everything I do. People tell me sometimes that i'm such a good friend, and how I always do good things and such. In reality, it was Victoria that molded me to be that way. I take the complements and smile, but deep inside, I know it's just another thing to owe to her.

She taught me how to love someone else, and what it really means to love. The dreams I had about sex and romance faded away, and instead, simply the person took the place of it. No longer was I infatuated or obsessed with things like her body or simply her personality. But now, I dream of the whole person. It's quite hard to describe, but the feeling is present with everyone I love, not just her. Even still, however, it was hard not to love someone without thinking of Victoria.

I will never forget the time I sat across from her in a pizza parlor. Our whole group was there. One of my best friends sat next to her. She had her arm on his the whole time. When we all left, they hugged for a long time before letting go. It was pretty clear what was going on. 

Did it hurt? Of course, it did. I felt like a red hot chain was being pulled from the center of my chest, yanking my heart with it. I threw up when I got home. But I could not say that I felt bad about the whole thing. After all, it was like a wish coming true. I knew the guy for years, and I knew they would be happy together. I get the best of both worlds, we're all happy and close to each other. The worst part about the whole ordeal is that, while everything was settled, my heart didn't believe it. I should be happy, right? I fall in love, become a better person, and the loose end is tied up. Everyone is happy, except me.

Unfortunately, there is not much to tell after that. We are all graduated now, and off our separate ways. Victoria and her boyfriend are in a happy, loving relationship. I told her that I had a crush on her and had gotten over it. It's something we all laugh at now. But, even after all these years, she never escapes my mind, my thoughts, and my dreams. It's still the same eyes that I long to be staring into when I wake up. Despite all of this, though, I will be forever grateful that, because of this experience, I have grown to be a better person, and experienced the true definition of love. 

I love you, Victoria. Thank you for everything.

I thought I have fallen in love before, the butterflies, the desperate longing. Yet no one told me that true, deep love, feels like heartbreak.

All things must pass, keep that in mind when you lie next to your beloved, truly appreciate the love you have in that moment.

You’re going to lose them, and there is no happy ever after, grief is a larger part of love than affection. 

I lost my father on March 31st, I loved the man dearly, one of my best friends, I have a giant hole in my heart. I just so happened to rekindle with one of the few people I have ever had significant feelings for around the same time, and things between us have become quite beautiful.

I love her, it’s been two months since we started seeing each other again, we want to take things slow but alas the heart wants what the heart wants. She says she cares about me, really likes me, attracted to me, and here I am head over heels. Beyond that, an ache really, like a call from a long distance, my life drawing me to this point, as I have always gone where the wind blows. 

I have come to this love from a deep sense of loss, I relish every moment as if a gift, and every terrible thing that’s happened to me in my life, the misery, is just washed away when I lie with her, every bad decision and insecurity gone with a kiss.

Love those around you unabashedly, our world is dying, and love won’t save it but in the end it’s all we have to live for.

SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO STILL THOUGHT I LOOKED THE SAME LOL.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We texted a lot more after that awkward silence of not speaking to each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We went on a group date and she still wasn’t attracted to me. I was losing hope. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still wanted to take her to prom. \nHowever, I found out like 5 guys attempted and all failed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decided to try as well, so I went with a group of friends to max brenner and surprised her with a dessert that said will you go prom with me. She said YESS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was so excited but I still really liked her.\nSome birds told me she didn’t like me like that so I was like it’s whatever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped texting her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week later, she texted me asking why I stopped texting her.\nI told her I liked her and it was hard to be just friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SHE TOLD ME SHE LIKED ME TOO. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We went on another date but I didn’t end up kissing her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my birthday, two months before end of school, I decided to throw a little party and invited all my friends.\nI got a little tipsy and she gave me my first kiss. \nwe had a great time and had a great senior year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three years later, I write this because we made three years a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still can’t believe this but I posted this here to say, try try try for someone you like. Don’t listen to others negative energy and go for what you believe in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for listening guys and hope you guys enjoyed it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2ranw', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'bsql4v', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'PharaohLeaf', 'num_crossposts': 1, 'num_comments': 9, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'house_only', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/offmychest/comments/bsql4v/3_years_of_chasing_the_girl_of_my_dreams_was/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'house_only', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bsql4v/3_years_of_chasing_the_girl_of_my_dreams_was/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 1489009, 'created_utc': 1558758611.0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",,self.offmychest,0,False,0,{},False,False,bsrezn,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,,,,[],,,dark,text,False,,{},False,,,,[],t3_bsrezn,False,0,0,,False,all_ads,/r/love/comments/bsrezn/love_happens_in_mysterious_ways/,False,6,False,,,False,5,,{},,,True,False,False,love,t5_2qhnh,r/love,40249,public,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BhT24cSR26q3nhZIvd98TnUNcRAmGcQ-UL0x3Fj10rU.jpg,140.0,140.0,Love happens in mysterious ways,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bsql4v/3_years_of_chasing_the_girl_of_my_dreams_was/,[],,False,all_ads,6

What is love?

I've always asked myself that question... 
Love Isn't just restricted to your partner/better half... Several factors, several relations, and most importantly, several relationships can be defined in the concept of *love.*
And although there are several of those concepts, theres a distinct difference between each of them...
I've never been able to experience most of them...

The most important factor, family...
I guess everyone can agree that family will always be the first place where one can experience love...
As the Tully words go *family, duty, honour*. There's a reason family stands firmly as the first. 

I've never experienced that love... Dad left us to rot perse, 12 years ago. Had a few bad encounters with that person through the years... It was difficult to grow without a father and see other people hug and chant *my father is a hero* while i just looked on and wondered what they meant. I gotta say, i still haven't gotten over that...
Mom is a narcissistic bitch and i was never able to connect with her. Infact, she never sought that connection in the first place. I was always shunned aside to make way for her grand crusaders... She always got the sympathy from the seperation, she always had a shoulder to cry on. I was never given that same treatment by my family... I've never been able to say *i love you* to her. The things have gotten so bad that I can't stand to look at her face. And it doesn't even matter cause she doesn't even care.
I've forsaken the statement *they love you in their own way...* or *they do care, but don't show...* Sometimes, they just don't do that... Believe me when I say that...
Thats two people gone...
Grandmother never really accepted me cause i was a boy, who resembled his father too much. Its been 12 years and my grandfather hasn't looked me in the eyes. We haven't had more than a few words in all these years..
The rest of the members, well they're pretty much useless...

Next up... Friends!!
This is one time when I'll say that I'm glad I've these people in my life... I couldn't have asked for better companions through this path...
I love them and as i said... I'm glad I've them in my life. Guess I'm not completely robbed of love... Thanks guys...
Ofcourse even though I've said that, I'll also put this experience down... *You're not everyone's cup of tea... So don't try to be one. Maybe you're a 180 year old wine...* I went through a shitty phase trying to understand this... And I'm still grief stricken at how the things have gone south for me. I'm completely and utterly broken... All because of friendship... 
This is the perfect place for a question; they say it always gets a whole Lotta worse before it gets a whole Lotta better, but nobody mentions what one must do when it gets a whole Lotta worse again... What does one do??

And finally...
The love of my life. 
I've never had one...

Story time; one of my best friends told me a story which got me thinking...
She was going through a tough time back then.. 
One night, she wished for a miracle. She wished for a person who'd take all her troubles away... And that person appeared.. they had their first anniversary two months back, and i have never been happier for her...


I know this is kind of selfish of me, but I've been wishing for a miracle for the last so many years. I know people say that *the time will come*, but at the same time one must know, how long should one wait? I haven't had many years to put behind me, i know... But even so..
I can't expect my friends to always be there for me, cause every single one of them has a commitment of their own. And its a different feeling altogether, to call a person *your own.* Someone who walks with you through your sadness and paves a path to your happiness...

I've never *experienced* the feeling of love. With friends, yes... But other than that, none.. i really wanna know how it feels like. All the knowledge I've about love is from reading all those romance books years ago when i was in college, trying to decipher the meaning of love... But i know now that those books aren't faithful...

Its really thought-provoking for me when I walk down this path alone and I don't get anyone to walk with me. One must understand that I can't always ask people around me... And one must know that I've walked alone for too long. Love oneself? I learnt that myself... Walking alone? I've done that too long...
I can't do either of those... 
I guess I'm just looking for a comfort in a different person. To love and to be loved are one of the best things ever. And to be loved by the person you call *your own* can be the best thing ever .. and I'm just wondering when my miracle will happen... I just want my miracle...

*It gets a whole Lotta better before it gets a whole lotta worse... But I'm caught in the whole lotta worse after it got a whole lotta better..*
Ya... That pretty much sums it up...

I'm sorry for all the ramble. I know i could've posted this in a different subreddit... But i just wanted you guys to have a say... From the perspective of love... And I'm sorry for the long read... And thank you for sticking till the end if you did...

I have strong feelings for her, and I think it has become love. I love her.

Let me share my story of us.


We’ve known each other since 1st grade. In 4th grade I developed my first crush, and it was on her. In 5th grade she was told that I had a crush on her, and it was humiliating to me. She was friendly with me, but I stayed nervous around her and didn’t attempt to connect with her. I was already a shy kid.

There’s a moment in 6th grade in math class where I sat behind her, and I had dropped my pencil under her desk. I was terrified to attempt to reach under her chair for it. I was so scared. And it was a perfect representation of how it was.

She had like an unobtainable presence to me, she was smart, beautiful, and friendly to people. She was too good for me.

I became antisocial when family troubles created a bad environment in middle school, it nourished depression that I never was aware of until last year. I would never dare talk to her or even interact socially with most others. It was a bad look when I was such a secluded person. I didn’t understand the consequences of my actions, all I cared about was video games and not feeling socially pressured. My self-esteem was low. I had points where I even excessively missed school despite being intelligently talented because I didn’t know what I was doing with myself. It was like this since at the end of 6th grade, up to the start of sophomore year. Then I looked back at everything in regret. I started to normalize, at least.

But there was a turning point I began to change, and it was because of her.

Sometime junior year, last year, I realized that I had special feelings for her I couldn’t ignore - the girl on the pedestal has reachable, in my mind. And yet she was so distant from me, even if I saw her everyday. I never interacted with her. I had little social interactions to begin with still. At the least, I was recognized as nice and smart by others, although quiet too. Worst yet, I learned she had the same boyfriend from 2 years ago, so any hope seemed grim. But I prayed for a chance, and prayed to be patient. I began to learn much more about her when I started paying attention. I felt like I also had to begin redeeming myself in some way for my failures, so I got driven to get straight A’s that year. And I did.

But I did falter at times in my hope, and submitted to depression or sin. I learned and grew, though. I learned to interact socially much better, and that I genuinely have a sense of humor, I can care, and I can have fun with others. I gained newfound interests, especially the outdoors. I treated my body better.
And it was all because of her, because I wanted to be good enough for her. 
Come February this year, senior year, I came to learn that my patience had been answered: she got out of her 3-year relationship at some point in the last couple months.

It was my chance. But how to proceed perplexed me. I waited for some sort of timing to be able to get closer to her, but I only got anxieties. It was hard to find enjoyment in things when I was left unsure of myself and left anxious, confused. She became my focus. I just needed to become focused, and to act on my feelings.

I had a dream to take her to prom. It was fast approaching. I didn’t really have a way of not seeming weird when trying to ask her, it felt to me. I never could find a chance to be near her and alone at the same time.

I had a moment of clarity that gave me a tremendous boost of confidence: I could write her a letter. It wouldn’t be forced and it wouldn’t put her on the spot. I could totally ask her that way.

I had a dilemma in writing the letter: was I just asking her to prom, or was I confessing my feelings to her? To make clear my intent, I went to find out if she had a prom date already. So to my luck, she did, unsurprising with how long I waited, and it was still only with a friend. It was devastating that I couldn’t have my dream, but I felt that she deserved to know my feelings anyway. 

So my aim of the letter was to be honest about my feelings, and tell her how wonderful she is and how much she means to me. 
Now I had full power at my disposal to tell her - to let it off my chest. It was crushing for me to hide these feelings for so long. But I gained insight in what I should do. My character was being tested.

Finally achieving the confidence to express myself gave me the greatest feelings of my life as I planned and wrote the letter. My heart rushed. I could conquer anything. It was the energy I had been praying for all this time. My unhealthy obsession with her became an authentic healthy love.

I think that this is the moment where I could declare that I love her. 

I considered how she’d feel, how much she knows about me, what we can relate with each other, the things I’m willing to do for her, and I wanted to be understanding of her.

She is so special to me.

It’s things like her beautiful smile, the sound of her soft voice, hearing her laugh, her eyes, her lovely face, her gorgeous blonde hair, her gifted smartness and talent, her vibrant personality, her friendliness, her likability, and her kindness that make her special to me.

She is also nostalgic to me because of our timelessness of memories, it’s been 8 years since she became my interest.

I had someone give her the letter two weeks ago because I couldn’t find the right time to myself. It was two days before prom, and during AP testing. It was terrible timing. I chose to give it to her at a bad time regardless because I felt she deserved to know as soon as possible, and things are coming to an end in high school. Was this a mistake?

I asked her in the letter to tell me how she feels and to take as long as she needs to do so. I also gave her my number case that’s how she wanted it done.

She hasn’t made her feelings known to me yet, and it’s been two weeks. She’s done nothing.

We graduate in two weeks. 

It’s been painful for me that she hasn’t told me anything, it makes me think I did something wrong or messed up. I don’t want her to be afraid of turning me down, I want her to understand that. If she’s unsure of herself, I want to be patient and wait. But I just don’t know.

We have made brief eye contact with each other frequently, and we both initiate it, I more often than her. Most recently, in one class we have together she was leaving the room, when she looked back directly at me and just for me, completely out of her way. What does this mean? Should I say hi to her when we pass each other to diffuse any awkwardness, or should I give her space? I want to be able to convey to her my confidence but be understanding of her.

It gave me a last bit of hope that maybe, she might come around to tell me the truth, no matter what it may be. I want her to be able to trust me. Maybe she’ll find the good in me.

We are both Christians and hold similar values, I know that I can resonate with her spiritually and ideologically. 

I want the chance for her to get to know me better and hope in our potential together.

I want to keep her tight in my arms, her to put her head on my shoulder, on my chest, cuddle with her, stroke her hair, hold hands with her and rub thumbs, watch the sunset with her that matches her beauty, giggle, laugh hysterically with her, take walks and hikes with her, watch movies with her, play video games with her (top priority is to show her Xenoblade), visit places with her, talk openly with her about silly and serious things, and lay in each other’s arms.

I can accept any decision she makes because I care about her. But I still pray for our chance together - our miracle. I want to be man enough for her.

I’ve experienced a surge of so many emotions, especially in the last month.

She’s been on my mind.
When I think of her, I get ecstatic feelings.

I want to cry my heart out in her arms.




I love you Elizabeth

&lt;p&gt;I had a dream to take her to prom. It was fast approaching. I didn’t really have a way of not seeming weird when trying to ask her, it felt to me. I never could find a chance to be near her and alone at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a moment of clarity that gave me a tremendous boost of confidence: I could write her a letter. It wouldn’t be forced and it wouldn’t put her on the spot. I could totally ask her that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a dilemma in writing the letter: was I just asking her to prom, or was I confessing my feelings to her? To make clear my intent, I went to find out if she had a prom date already. So to my luck, she did, unsurprising with how long I waited, and it was still only with a friend. It was devastating that I couldn’t have my dream, but I felt that she deserved to know my feelings anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my aim of the letter was to be honest about my feelings, and tell her how wonderful she is and how much she means to me. 
Now I had full power at my disposal to tell her - to let it off my chest. It was crushing for me to hide these feelings for so long. But I gained insight in what I should do. My character was being tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally achieving the confidence to express myself gave me the greatest feelings of my life as I planned and wrote the letter. My heart rushed. I could conquer anything. It was the energy I had been praying for all this time. My unhealthy obsession with her became an authentic healthy love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that this is the moment where I could declare that I love her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I considered how she’d feel, how much she knows about me, what we can relate with each other, the things I’m willing to do for her, and I wanted to be understanding of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is so special to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s things like her beautiful smile, the sound of her soft voice, hearing her laugh, her eyes, her lovely face, her gorgeous blonde hair, her gifted smartness and talent, her vibrant personality, her friendliness, her likability, and her kindness that make her special to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is also nostalgic to me because of our timelessness of memories, it’s been 8 years since she became my interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had someone give her the letter two weeks ago because I couldn’t find the right time to myself. It was two days before prom, and during AP testing. It was terrible timing. I chose to give it to her at a bad time regardless because I felt she deserved to know as soon as possible, and things are coming to an end in high school. Was this a mistake?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked her in the letter to tell me how she feels and to take as long as she needs to do so. I also gave her my number case that’s how she wanted it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hasn’t made her feelings known to me yet, and it’s been two weeks. She’s done nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We graduate in two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been painful for me that she hasn’t told me anything, it makes me think I did something wrong or messed up. I don’t want her to be afraid of turning me down, I want her to understand that. If she’s unsure of herself, I want to be patient and wait. But I just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made brief eye contact with each other frequently, and we both initiate it, I more often than her. Most recently, in one class we have together she was leaving the room, when she looked back directly at me and just for me, completely out of her way. What does this mean? Should I say hi to her when we pass each other to diffuse any awkwardness, or should I give her space? I want to be able to convey to her my confidence but be understanding of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gave me a last bit of hope that maybe, she might come around to tell me the truth, no matter what it may be. I want her to be able to trust me. Maybe she’ll find the good in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are both Christians and hold similar values, I know that I can resonate with her spiritually and ideologically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the chance for her to get to know me better and hope in our potential together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to keep her tight in my arms, her to put her head on my shoulder, on my chest, cuddle with her, stroke her hair, hold hands with her and rub thumbs, watch the sunset with her that matches her beauty, giggle, laugh hysterically with her, take walks and hikes with her, watch movies with her, play video games with her (top priority is to show her Xenoblade), visit places with her, talk openly with her about silly and serious things, and lay in each other’s arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can accept any decision she makes because I care about her. But I still pray for our chance together - our miracle. I want to be man enough for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve experienced a surge of so many emotions, especially in the last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s been on my mind.
When I think of her, I get ecstatic feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to cry my heart out in her arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you Elizabeth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(P.S. Would anyone be interested in reading the letter I wrote her? I have a typed draft of it)&lt;/p&gt;

He stood, as the men relaxed around the fire. “I will be back soon, men.”

He charged out towards the road, pulling his fur hat over his head and stomped through the snow. They had agreed to meet at the main highway road, the Icelanders had called highway 9. He stood straight, looking around. Nothing. Silence.

*Darn it, he thought. He missed her. She must have thought he was not interested anymore and left.*

“Anwa!” he shouted into the bushes.

His heart fell with disappointment. Damn snow!

“Nathanael. I’m here. On the west side of the road,” she shouted back.

His heart leapt. He ran across the road to the line of trees and met her on the west side. “Sorry, I am late! The first heavy snowfall! We had to shovel our way out! Christ’s Sake! Does it always snow like this?”

Anwa was dressed in a heavy deer skin coat and a fur hat. “Yes, we usually get a lot of snow. Sometimes 150cm on the ground in a bad winter.”

Nathanael hugged her warmly. “How have you been, Anwa?” he mumbled in her ear, while hugging her tight.

She turned her head into his shoulder. “Cold,” she chuckled. She didn’t move to break the embrace, instead cuddling closer into his chest. The warmth they created together wrapped around them, enveloping them both in a loving embrace. It was comfortable, serene and somehow necessary. Their bodies moulded into each other so easily, almost as if they fit so perfectly together, no questions asked, like a missing puzzle piece.

“I missed you,” Nath mumbled.

Tingles ran up Anwa’s spine. His words scurried through her body, lifting her spirits. She had missed him too. She debated whether to tell him. She didn’t want to appear too eager.

“I was thinking that you weren’t going to come,” she said instead. “I was going to leave. I was feeling disappointed.”

“I’m glad you waited,” he replied. Nath pulled her chin up and looked into her eyes. “Thank you.” He kissed her lips slowly, relishing in her softness. She opened her mouth and let his tongue explore her tongue. Her vagina moistened instantly. “Mmm,” she murmured.

Nathanael instinctively continued the tongue dances inside her mouth. She murmured again. His hands reached around her, trailing lightly over her lower back. He pressed into her lower back, holding her tighter, wishing he could feel her buttocks, but knowing that it was not a gentlemanly thing to do. She groaned.

His cock hardened fully, yearning to enter her. His head felt dizzy. 

She broke the kiss. 

They both looked at each other, up close and intimate. Her lips were swollen and red. She was panting lightly. His lips were full and wet. “We are here to hunt deer,” she stated simply.

“Yes,” Nath replied, breathlessly. “Just one more kiss, then we will hunt deer with arrows.”

“Alright,” she relented, easily.

Nath cupped her chin and leaned forward. “I love kissing your lips, feels like heaven.” Her body tingled with electric impulses as his lips joined hers again. His hot tongue explored her mouth. Anwa felt like she was melting away in his arms. She sucked on his lower lip and he groaned. His lips were hot and hungry. His hands were moving all over her back. Her vagina was wetting her hunting pants.

Anwa broke the kiss again. 

“We must hunt now,” she stated, but making no movement at all to come out of his embrace.

Nath looked down at her, then kissed her on the top of her head. “Alright, alright,” he relented, “we will hunt. Where are the arrows?”

&lt;p&gt;“Alright,” she relented, easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nath cupped her chin and leaned forward. “I love kissing your lips, feels like heaven.” Her body tingled with electric impulses as his lips joined hers again. His hot tongue explored her mouth. Anwa felt like she was melting away in his arms. She sucked on his lower lip and he groaned. His lips were hot and hungry. His hands were moving all over her back. Her vagina was wetting her hunting pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anwa broke the kiss again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We must hunt now,” she stated, but making no movement at all to come out of his embrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nath looked down at her, then kissed her on the top of her head. “Alright, alright,” he relented, “we will hunt. Where are the arrows?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued...&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to create a blog focused on sharing user stories on what love means to them. This does not mean solely romantic love but can be platonic as well as love for an activity. Really it's about how people interpret the meaning of the word love. I was hoping to gather stories with 3 elements:

1. What does love mean to you?
2. A time you experienced what you perceived to be loved
3. A photo representation of what you feel love is (optional)

Of course, when the blog gets up and running I will share the link here :)

P.S. please keep the content appropriate","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

I think it's pretty interesting how falling for someone makes you see them in a completely different light. Things that may have never caught your interest before are suddenly insanely attractive. You notice things about people that you never payed attention to before.

She is my best friend- if not a bit shy, we play games together, talk about stuff, and pretty much message each other every day. It's beautiful, and so is she.

But the thing is, as much as i resisted, as much as i knew that she was still getting over a bad relationship, i started having feelings for her, and now they're stronger than a titanium re-enforced structural beam. 

The reason why this all pains me so is that for every night i dream about her and every day i think about her, is that when it comes to emotions, and emotionally heavy conversation, she kind of shuts down in response. And secondly, i wouldn't want to ruin such a great friendship over the sake of my feelings. 

So, i feel- unless she of her own accord feels for me what i feel for her, she will never know my true desire burning in my heart with every beat, and for the time being, my feelings must remain a secret, while I do everything in my power to make sure she is happy.

&lt;p&gt;The reason why this all pains me so is that for every night i dream about her and every day i think about her, is that when it comes to emotions, and emotionally heavy conversation, she kind of shuts down in response. And secondly, i wouldn&amp;#39;t want to ruin such a great friendship over the sake of my feelings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, i feel- unless she of her own accord feels for me what i feel for her, she will never know my true desire burning in my heart with every beat, and for the time being, my feelings must remain a secret, while I do everything in my power to make sure she is happy. It isn&amp;#39;t perfect, but as long as my beloved is happy, then it is all i can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s good to get this unrequited love off of my chest, reddit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

so this might sound childish right now, and i don't know if this is the right subreddit, but for a few years now I'm constantly wondering what it would be like being in a relationship with someone. I'm  M18 and I've been in love quite a few times, but it never led to anything. It either ended up with me being in love with someone who didn't even know me, (tbh i didn't even know them either) or just never taking actions until we both lost intetest. And that's the problem. I just don't know how that stuff works. Nobody ever taught me. I've always been an introverted guy, and I've more or less succeeded to open up a bit in the past few years.. but I still have a hard time talking to (especially) girls. See, it's not like I don't know at all how to treat them. I know that you should hold the door for them, be nice but not too close, softly touch her to make first contact, all that stuff you always hear. blah blah. I can be quite charming if i have to, actually. But that just always ends with the conversation being over before something happens that would build my experience with the other gender. Like it's just small talk. I don't get joy out of that. I feel nothing, actually. Since I go to the gym and get more mature in general, I actually notice that some women look at me like they find me attractive, but that's it. I just smile back, continue doing whatever i just did, thinking ''what do I have to do now''
So this desire to be loved has grown so strong recently that i start to act weird whenever I happen to fall in love with somebody. I'm always checking my phone, posting something just so she sees it, then I get frustrated because she doesn't react to it. Simply because I don't know how to express myself otherwise. And in the end that good feeling always turns to hate, frustration, even obsession... 
Do you understand how I'm feeling? I know that there's a lot of potential inside of me but I don't know how to reach it. Can any of you maybe help me?
thanks

Now, I want to ask her this question: &amp;quot;And dear M., do you know about that feeling, the feeling of being at a distance of 10min, 2000 steps, a kilometer from the person you are in love with, working 3min away from each other and you can not see her, touch her and hear her because she said that&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;I am okay now&amp;quot; ?
I think this unpleasant sensation is 10 times stronger than when I was 2,000 miles away because what&amp;#39;s the conclusion .. So close we are, yet so far away ....&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I'm generally a pretty optimistic person, my love life has been lacking. I've been having bad experience after bad experience and now I built up pretty heavy trust issues. I am trans and I always tell people that I am before there's any dating involved and often people lose interest in my just because of that fact and tell me straight up, but I've had the bad luck of a couple people trying not to hurt my feelings (or not wanting to come across transphobic) and leading me on.

In other cases it just doesn't work out, they just lose interest or don't have any at all, and often I feel ashamed that I made a fool of myself by admitting my feelings and getting those not back, which I don't blame them for by the way, it really be like that.

My trust issues got so bad one time that I didn't want to hug anyone and got really emotionally and physically distant from friends and family. Also because of other things in in my life the supressing feeling of not deserving love tries to spread from my mind to all the veins in my body.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I've been getting closer with a girl that I befriended this year. We have amazing chemistry and I feel she's comfortable with me, which somehow I find unbelievable.

She walks over to me when she sees me, hugs me when she leaves, says ''I'll probably see you sometime in the future''.

Lately, I noticed she tends to get some of the slang and sayings I often use in her vocabulary. For example I'd like to say ''We'll burn the bridge when we get to it'' and ''Bold of you to assume that you're allowed in my heart'' (I say this ironicly) and things like that and I think it's so funny when I hear her repeat it to me or her friends.

I grabbed her hand and she let me hold it, laughs when I make a joke, cuddled up to me when we were both a bit tipsy and it was late at night. She trusts me with her secrets and I trust her with mine.

Maybe she's comfortable with me, as she softly breathes against my face. She doesn't pull away when I have my arm around her. She knows the lyrics to my favourite song by heart.

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm talking with her I just feel like a boy, in love with a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her out on a date a couple weeks before finals, and we agreed to go after those. Now that they are over her parents took her on a surprise holiday and honestly I miss her so much.

&amp;#x200B;

She said she's confused with herself, which I understand at this point, dating someone like me is never easy, I always say that ''I come with a DLC that makes the main game a hell lot harder, and you have to beat it to play the main game again''.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the emotions in this post are all over the place, but that's how I am. Reading what I just wrote is making me realize how incredibly in love I am for the first time in years, but on the other hand the doubt is eating me up from inside. All my friends say that I should go for it and I'm tempted to just go all out, knowing that if she retreats I'll just end up like all the other times, just time with a bigger tear in my heart.

I didn't know she was gay at first and she hadn't come out yet because she had a boyfriend at the time. As time passed by, we grew closer and closer but everything remained platonic. At some point, she came out to her closest family members, which included my ex, her cousin. So I found out and it obviously didn't change anything but it matters in this situation. Now my ex and her cousin were really close. They still are now, just not as much. So we all hung out a lot. My ex's cousin started dating a girl after a while, and mind you that everything is still very much platonic. All 4 of us got along so well. We hung out a lot and had the best of times. As the hangouts piled on, the more my ex's cousin and I grew closer. The chemistry between us was literally nothing like I've ever had with anyone..but again.. very much platonic. She was now my best friend. I got her a job where I work and we grew even closer there. We even felt comfortable enough sleeping on the same bed. We loved spending time together but our significant others started feeling a bit weird about it. They wouldn't want to hang out all together as much, if ever. My ex's cousin and I still managed to sneak in some hangouts here and there because for us we had no ill intention. A few years pass and now my ex's cousin and I are close AF but something happens.. my ex and I break up. I'm convinced I've lost the most important person in my life and I'm not even talking about my ex. I was more worried about losing her cousin than losing her! (Just an fyi, I know I'm a piece of shit). But somehow, by some miraculous feat of some higher power, her cousin still wants to be friends. (Just a little disclaimer, my ex's cousin hated how my ex treated me. Don't think that does anything but whatever). At this point my ex has moved on and I confide in her cousin about how torn I was. We grew even closer. Her cousin knew that we hung out but not to what extent. My now best friend and her girlfriend at the time have broken up. I am now the one that is there for her. Now we're planning vacations, getaways, hangouts, the whole 9. So she tells her cousin about how close we are and surprisingly, she is very ok with it. Now that we have the green light, we hang out as much as we can. At this point, I'm still not into her like that. We're still best friends. So she starts seeing another girl. We all hang out a lot. A very cool super laid back girl, so we thought. Long story short, that didn't work out and my best friend got played. So we fall back on each other once again. To be honest, I don't know exactly when I start falling for this girl but it was around this time. Which isn't very far from present day. I got to tell you (whoever is reading this), you'd fall for her too. She is the most caring, loving, generous, kind hearted person you'd ever meet and to top it all off she is literally the funniest person I've ever met. She absolutely lights up any room she's in. Anyway.. now we're both single again. I start falling for this girl at my new job. Like falling HARD. I didn't know what was happening and I obviously still wasn't aware of my feelings for my best friend. In hindsight, I guess I was looking to fill a void. I started hanging out with this other girl a lot and we got along really well. (Nowhere close to my best friend and I but still miles ahead of anyone else including my ex). Again, long story short, she ended up stringing me along and had a boyfriend the entire time. That's fine. I moved on relatively quick to my surprise. My best friend was against that relationship from the get go. I feel like I'm zooming through a lot of shit and I'm sorry. I'm sort of just venting at this point because I literally have no one else to talk about this to lol and again, I know I'm a piece of shit. My ex's cousin and I are literally soulmates at this point, the love I feel for her is beyond anything I'd ever thought possible. I guess I just didn't know how much it really was. We would always talk about how friends should be able to fuck without any complicated bullshit. My best friend and I just came back from a little trip to some chalet with some friends. During that time, something happened. We thought we were going to share a bed this whole time and we were both very ok with this as it was done before. But when we got there, we realized that we had two separate beds in one room. This bummed me out for some reason (Reasons clear to me now) and obviously it would be weird for us to leave the beds to anyone else as the only other people there were two couples. Yet I still heard her trying to give the beds away to both couples lol and I won't lie I was trying the same. So first night, I got a bit wasted and for some odd fucking reason, I decided to take my shit off my bed and sleep on the floor next to hers. Don't ask why. When we wake up, I say that this sucks because we're so far and she makes a comment along the lines of: ""Yea you wanted a sleepover and this isn't a sleepover if we're this far"". So my brain took that as a sign. I suggested I push both beds together tonight and she was down for that. So the day goes by and night times around the corner. I'm pretty beat so I head upstairs to move those beds together and get ready for bed. She comes upstairs not too long after me and says: ""Don't worry I'm coming to bed soon"" which means nothing, I don't even know why I'm mentioning it. She gets upstairs and comes into bed.. I'm telling you guys right now, this was hands absolutely the hell down, the funnest night I've ever had in my entire life. We stayed up and laughed for HOURS. Her laugh made my hairs stand up every time. After a very long time, we agreed to go to sleep. Now this is where things get crazy and also is the reason for this post. I woke up and completely out of nature, decided to hold her from the back as if to spoon her. She said: ""Are you spooning me?"" And I responded: ""Yea.. is that ok?"" And she nodded: ""Yes"". Now at this point, I should've retracted even if she said yes because it isn't right but, and I'm sure this is just me exaggerating, I kept feeling her push her butt against my junk every now and then. Like in the slightest way possible. Nothing else happened that night. We woke up and everything was back to normal, for me at least. I don't know what she was feeling but we were in the backyard at some point, and I apologized for spooning her and she laughed it off. Now present day, everything is back to normal and we still love each other very much.

You would say hi, your lips would curl.
Alas, at the time I was oblivious,
That if I asked you to by mine, you’d say “yes”.

Your giggle always had me from the start,
The way your eyes shone, I could see your heart.
I knew, even before love, that you were special,
And if you asked to be mine, I’d say “I shall”.

Summer passed away, while my love grew,
The gleam in your eyes told me to protect you.
Your smile was the most beautiful I’ll see,
Unknowist to me, with that smile came a fee.

We had our first kiss, it was heaven and more,
When I pulled away, your look was one to adore.
I spent the day in a dreamlike state,
Wondering why any human would feel hate.

One day, you told me news I saw coming,
You told me you wanted to focus on running.
You’re a big track star, I should’ve known,
That running is the only thing to what your love will have grown.

That spring was a disaster, I yelled at my mum,
I didn’t feel like a human, just one existing atom.
Other girls tried to pursue me, but they couldn’t compare,
To the one and only love I had, my only care.

Summer came, and with it grew happiness,
Which, previously, was devoured by the loch-ness.
I enjoyed my friends, and looked upon,
The simple pleasures in life without a yawn.

Then, fall was not a season, but a call for help,
She had lost her closest family, so she lay with a yelp.
I consoled her, I cared for her so,
And after a month, we decided to give it another go.




So thankful was I, my love was back,
My whole world has recovered from black.
She was the sole reason for my care,
My hopelessness hibernated like a bear.

I knew this love wouldn’t last, so I told myself,
I’d do everything I could, leave nothing on the shelf.
Tell her I love her every chance I have,
Our love was as sweet as the juiciest agave.

Everybody loved us, we were the perfect couple,
I cared about her so, we rarely had a hustle.
I was there for her when she felt alone,
I told her what would quit me from her, none.

Over time, she started to sway distant,
And I knew, let this opportunity pass, I can’t.
I invited her over one day to cuddle,
We looked into each other’s eyes, connected like a puddle.

Her eyes told me love, care, and tenderness,
I couldn’t bare to feel them from her any less.
She was my soulmate, my knight in shining armor,
My mission to her was to let our love conquer.

On a sorrowful day, she came up to me,
Her feelings have gone, like a stinger to a bee.
I knew this day would come, I couldn’t do anything,
But sit in desolate silence, no more dreaming of a ring.

This, all over the span of two years,
The first girl to love me, the first to dry my tears.
She made me feel special, like the only boy in the world,
Now I am but a reminder of our love, burned.

What did I do wrong? I would’ve done anything,
To save us, like a sacrifice to a king.
People tell me it may not be the end,
I hope not, I would die to give my love one more send.




Two months later, she’s still the girl I love.
The one that all my feelings rise above.
There’s nobody like her, she’s so sweet,
If any girl wanted me, they’d have someone to beat.

I love you C, with all my heart,
You gave me hope from the start.
You will always be my best friend,
Thank you for everything, the end?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we first met, you were the shy girl,

The first time I fell in love was at the age of 25, The relationship lasted for a mere two months but it changed my life profoundly, I had one previous relationship before this and it lasted for about 4 years before we parted ways, which was for the best I realize now.

I always thought of myself as a person who could never fall in love before this, it happened at a time of my life when I was not really sure of myself as a person and it was probably not the best time for us to be in a relationship, since she had ended a long standing previous relationship and I wasn’t ready for a relationship by no means. 

Our feelings for each other began like fire, but it lasted for a couple of days before it ended, and after about 3 months of heartbreak and pain it bloomed again to fail again in less than a month.

I knew from the moment I met her she was the one for me and no matter what she did to me, I would always be at her side. After all this I realize now that maybe sometimes love is not enough to make things work, it is the importance of love in a person’s life at the right place and right time to work right.

Neither I was ready to be in a relationship with her and neither was she, I had a lot of barriers as a person as I grew up, always afraid that someone would break my trust, that I would never be loved back, or I would lose the control I had over myself and I see now that I was wrong, without being vulnerable as a person a person cannot really experience true joy, because of all the overwhelmingly negative feelings I had it didn’t take me long to make it toxic for her, and my girlfriend then was just out of a serious long term relationship and I guess I should have understood the situation that she wouldn’t be able to give her best as well.

I realize that there is not much you can do to a relationship which is six feet under, you can only learn to be a better person and move on in life and be the best you can be, you learn from your mistakes and that is how you grow as a person, If love found you at the wrong time, please be patient and give it time if you are reading this, it’ll all be better in the end.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time I fell in love was at the age of 25, The relationship lasted for a mere two months but it changed my life profoundly, I had one previous relationship before this and it lasted for about 4 years before we parted ways, which was for the best I realize now.&lt;/p&gt;

For more than 6 years I am in love with one girl. The most amazing and beautiful person I have ever met, someone I consider absolutely and utmost special. But we are not together. We have never been together. I always felt that we are close, that there is a connection, something between us. I thought that trust and admiration towards one another is mutual, maybe even vague signs of love from her side. So, after a long time, I expressed my love for her a month ago or so. And what was her reaction? That she really, really likes me, but she is not sure if she loves me yet. She did not say to be just friends. She did not say that it would not work. She said, she has a lot of things on her mind now and is confused. Is love really that complicated? You can tell if you either love someone or not, or am I just that naive to think so? 
(Circumstances are also playing a big role and I understand that she doesn't want to be hurt by letting me in her love life. I am leaving for 3 months, she is also considering moving away for a year to study abroad, with the possibility of staying there afterwards, and to be honest, I support it as I know, she wants it and would probably be happy there, I want the best for her and by doing/saying that I support her, I am not helping myself or her).

For 6 years, I have been doing everything I could to prove myself worthy when we were somewhere together. I helped her, been there for her and she for me when we needed support over those years, small stuff mainly that we dealt with via messages. When outside, I just couldn't stop looking at her (whether we were alone or with friends). When she was sitting next to me and leaned a little closer towards me, I was always scared to touch her, but I did and she never got ""scared"", didn't move away from me. I always tried to keep her calm when before exams etc. A lot of small things we did for each other, but mainly done by me.

After a month, I still have no answer from her regarding her feelings for me. It's like a poison. I can't properly focus on my exams, I can't focus on work, I have her on my mind all the time. Knowing that she doesn't love me would be a redemption. Actually, any answer would be. Of course I would love her to love me, but even if she wanted to stay friends and said no, I would not be mad at all. I would get over it over time, I am sure of it, even though I would probably still love her for a very long time after that. It would be a first step of ""self-healing"", if you know what I mean. (also, please, if you feel/were told by a guy/girl that they love you, like when you know and feel they truly mean it, don't leave him/her waiting for the answer as waiting is slowly destroying them)

I have never done this. This is my first post on reddit ever and I am not even sure if I am doing the right thing, but I really need to get it out and friends don't understand the depth of my love for her very well. I am putting her interests and well-being over mine, even if it means it doesn't include me. I didn't wanted to ask her and force her to give me the answer as I know it would bother her as much as it bothers me and she would be sad. And I don't want to make her sad. So there I am, partially heartbroken, alone.

I should probably make another first step and let her know that despite not knowing how she feels, I have to move on and therefore cut her off from my life if that's possible. But I just love that girl more than anything.
Sorry for the long post, I just had to get it off my chest.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

I just wanted anyone who read my previous letter(s) to know that Alessia did come to say happy birthday. She actually spend the rest of the day with me. We went to pick up my watch that was in for servicing at the jeweler. We looked at the shiny engagement rings and I looked at her while she dreamt. I didn't see that dream in her eyes that used to be the same as mine. 

We went to the motorcycle dealership where I used to go as a kid to dream. I tried a bike I was interested in just for a minute on their lot. Alessia doesn't like that I'm into motorcycles because she thinks they're dangerous. But I made her get on the bike with me and hold on to me as I slowly rode it. It was my dream to do that with her just once and I loved it. 

Then she came to my parents house with me where we had dinner. My family always loved Alessia. My cousin and best friend Gennaro who I love was there also. I had a great 26th birthday and I'm so happy that I got to spend it with the people I love. 

Alessia will read my posts. Alessia, my angel, words can not express how much I love you. From the second we met as teenagers and even before that I have loved you more than anything in the world. And it will never stop. I loved every second I ever spend with you. Thank you for everything. Don't be mad at me, ok baby? Be happy, my treasure. You are so beautiful my dearest Alessia. I have to stop writing now.

By the end my now-GF was crying because it (this tore my heart inside) 'was the first time someone has confessed to me.'  After my mate asked 'Why aren't you two dating?', I decided it was time to let it all out... 



'Ever since I was in high school, I was envious when some of my close friends got girlfriends. I knew I shouldn't have been but all I ever wanted was to experience a normal love, or so I thought.

When you found the 'one', I asked someone what it meant. She said that half the time without even thinking you daydream about them, every time you go to an event with them you make an extra half hour worth of effort to impress... 

Being considerate for me meant I fell down twice. So I vowed never to let an opportunity slip. I, like Yuuji took down notes to try and remember what you liked and disliked, what I needed to do so I didn't repeat both my own and past people's mistakes. Then Sunday happened. I was honestly unsure before if it was real, but that was the best day of my life. I felt like a kid again and knowing I had a shot at starting something, I was over and under the moon like the Fury Dragons. I forgot about everything that didn't matter and only focused on the one thing that did. You. 

So... I want... No, I need to be like Toothless and the Light Fury. Looking out for each other, confiding within. The only step left is to try and work each other out, but in the way I think we've both wanted.

To accept and divulge all of out beings into each other. To bare our all and not be judged for it like everyone else has in our lives. You've seen that we've clicked like no one else has in our lives. I'm crying writing this because I never thought in my wildest dreams that this would ever happen. I went from self harm to loving someone in three years. I never thought this endless black tunnel would turn into a nightshow full of wonderful colour... 

I need you. I have never gone out with anyone else before so I'd be naive and dumb. I have my stupidity streaks and my mother (just like yours) is possessive and wants to control my every move. I will always feel inferior unless someone accesses me completely for who I am, and the list goes on. But I NEED to be with you. Even if it's by call, or by some other form I love every second of it. Everything I've wanted in life always falls apart so I didn't want anything. Now that my feelings are slowly being reciprocated, it shows with how happy I am at work. People have started to show confidence in me at work, I'm talked to by my managers like a human being worthy of having conversations with. 

For you to give me confidence like you do... Nothing else matters. There weren't any depression clouds in my mind when you told me that you believed in me all along. It always feels like I was walking on air wherever I go with you, but now...

That also why I hate he expression &amp;quot;better half&amp;quot; because I feel amazing on my own . I&amp;#39;m not lonely or anything, I just don&amp;#39;t see the point. 
I want to have children but I want to raise them on my own, I&amp;#39;m all they need. Just my opinion 🤷‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

2012

When I was in junior high I met this very pretty and gorgeous girl. She was very bright and I would play around with her. Crack jokes and laugh till one point I started to like her. And I liked her a lot. But to cut things short middle school was ending and I had great feelings for her. 

2016-17

During Highschool we changed a lot. I became more outgoing than ever before. I was an extrovert before but I was becoming more and more open through out the years. My junior year I met her again and she was so completely different. We met in French and we started to talk once more. In the class I was informed by her that she was now an extrovert just like me. (When I met her she was a little shy)  I was happy about that. Till she mentioned she liked to smoke weed and drink. Of which I did not like at all. I can handle weed and alcohol, but not when it  is in excess. We would talk and talk and I would fall for her again. I felt that I loved her. I felt like it was love. I would flirt with her.  Several months passed and I wanted to ask her out on a date. Of which out of the blue started to ignore me. I ofcourse felt terrible. I stopped talking to her and I started to talk to someone else..... (this would be the other part of the story. I'll tell it another time as it is also a good one.) 

2019
So after highschool I attended College (Currently a sophomore) A majority of my friends disappeared.  I became a lot more serious. I started to focus more on my education and on my major of which is in business. One day met her once more. I loved seeing her again. And I got to know her for several minutes once more. We talked and talked and it turned out we became total opposites. I become a lot more serious with my life and she claims that she became a lot more carefree. Partying and drinking and not caring for school or her future. After our interaction I started to grow a feeling once more of me liking her. Yet I'm on the fence about it. I have the ability to ask her out. But I dont wish too. I'm having a hard time to decide (going back to me talking to another girl in highschool) as I have feelings for another girl. 

I just want to get it off my chest as I never thought i would see her again but now i feel like the person upstairs (God) is trying to get me to fall for her. And honestly I could, I've known her for years. I'm just not too sure if I want her or the other girl (again another story for another)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So heres a story for what I assume a short part of a long one. &lt;/p&gt;

There was a blind girl who hated herself purely for the fact she was blind. The only person she didn’t hate was her loving boyfriend, as he was always there for her. She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry him.



One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her –

 now she could see everything, including her boyfriend.

 Her boyfriend asked her, 

“now that you can see the world, will you marry me?”



The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was blind too, and refused to marry him. Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying:

“Just take care of my eyes dear.”

Like any idea we're not willing to accept, the cruel absence of somebody to love and be loved by, takes us through painful emotions that leave behind only exhaustion.

First of all, I want you to let go of that burden.Think of everything you regret about your love life. Think of everything you believe is preventing you from finding love. And let it go.

No, there aren't any flaws in you that keeps away love from you. No, nobody can become out of date, because you're not a damn yogurt. No, lacking that one knowledge or that one experience you heard about, it has nothing to do with the ability to love and be loved. No, no giant hands in the sky pops out to prevent you from meeting somebody. No cursed destiny stands between you and love.

Letting go.It's not a magical mantra, and is actually hard, as it requires a strong will, training, obstinacy, until you finally accept to let go of those heavy emotions. Which means, giving them less value, realizing how they do not matter as much as you think they do at the moment.

Remember that everyone had to let go of something – small or big - they thought was a part of them, at some point of their lives. A singer that lost her voice, a husband that lost his wife, a young man that lost his hair, a baby that lost his teddy bear. The hardship can be endless until you accept what's become your reality, and start feeling yourself again.

The feelings, they are inside you, like a treasure in a castle from which you are the master.

You want to feel better, right ? Why wait for somebody? Do you know your reasons clear and loud to wait ? You know deep down, that feeling of lacking something, it's because you turned down the simple and little joys of life in favor of something you believe is bigger. You weren't mindful.

I don't know if you've already experienced that : one time or more, you wanted to do something badly, because you knew you were going to enjoy it so much ! but you didn't want to do it alone – the more, the merrier you innocently thought ; but nobody was available, or wanted to.

How heart-breaking.

Waiting for love can do us such a harm. All the joyful activities, small pleasures, new hobbies we are waiting to do with some future special someone, it's like sparing fruits again and again instead of eating them. For a time they will last, but in the end all that joy you spared, it has rotten. It's lost.

That mistake we all make it, all the time. But I know you're smart, and you have a strong will. It's time to lighten up, and let go of the waiting.

That's the most important step you will ever take in order for love to, finally, find you.It starts the moment you stop searching for it.

You may have heard that love is something we don't have a hold onto, which relies only on destiny ; or something similar about how physical or psychological chemistry is or isn't ; that people are meant to be together, or not.

You read this text probably because you not only have hope to find love, but also have the will to take things into hand, as much as it may be possible, to finally make it happen.

The heart of this text is to take the problem from a fresh angle.You won't find love. *Love* will find you.

That requires you to stop thinking of yourself as the half of a future relationship, and instead embrace your full individuality. You don't have to deny your social needs or change your life in any way. What I highly recommend is that you start thinking of any alone time you have, like an opportunity to enjoy your own company. Become your friend, entertain yourself, never cancel something you want to do because you have to do it alone and instead, bravely go on discovering how it feels, to be you, in that new situation. Be bold and go get some alone time ! Be yourself, without anybody you know watching. Reconnect with that freedom, and on the road, if you meet any interesting person, be confident, because : he, or she, will have met you just as you truly are.

Start friendships in new places you always wanted to go, and acquaintances in classes you always wanted to take. Don't be afraid to work toward your personal joys, even the smallest like tasting a new ice cream. Build your happiness, one smile at a time, whatever the size or intensity of the smile. Who cares, right ? Don't let anyone dare measure your happiness and judge what's true to you. Best intentions often come from people who forgot that everybody is a unique piece of the universe and, damn, there's no recipe that's made for everyone.Yes, you can include that text into the recipes that may work, or not.

What if you think you start having feelings again or start thinking of someone ?

Our feelings and thoughts all lie in that secret garden of ours, which is our inner world. A world built since we were born, only on words we tell ourselves, beliefs, memories of feelings we had, scenes we've seen. Nothing makes us more human than that inner story ; it tells us, who we are.

Now, like in any storytelling, you know hardship is to come when the tone gets tense and anxious. That's exactly what many of us do, when launching a quest for love. Love becomes the big deal, and our surroundings become dungeons we're afraid *and* excited to explore.

I know some of you, dear readers, will argue that you don't do that, and basically just keep an open eye until something happens. I would argue back that you most probably are just like a lion sleeping ; comes the time when somebody catches your eye, and that person will become your quest, am I right ?

Hear me attentively : It's the quest that makes the dragon. Building up tension about a potential mate, about a potentiel encounter, about that already special someone, stressing about how you're dressed, is your job good enough, will you still be free if it works, will the sex be good happily after ever... Whatever. You're just building up tension. That's how you let yourself be burried into great illusions and fears, and end up acting like somebody you think you should be and picking up partners that you think you should pick, because you don't have a choice or else.

Stop, just stop putting on love the responsibility of the disappointments and failures that follows. « Why can't I be in love ? Why he/she can't be in love with me ? Why our love has end ? » you ask yourself often.

Oh love, it doesn't make anybody blind : it makes you see the true beauty of somebody else.Love never suddenly stops. Love never suddenly happens.

Passion, on the other hand, which is like a beautiful cristal made out of pure tension, it will turn your head, blind your eyes and yes, your heart. It can hit you in the fraction of a second, as you accidentally touches someones hand, see a strikingly beautiful face or just had smell the most attractive pheromons ever. Because passion depends deeply on your inner stories, physiological and psychological reflexes, passion feels like you’re in touch with your soul. Which is true. But that is absolutely *not* what love is about.

Passion is about yourself and how you can feel alive and true.Love is about someone else and how you can live truthfully with that person.

Don't get me wrong, I know the sweet feeling of growing dreams of romance. It's just that you want your dreams to become a tangible, long lasting love. And so do I. With every dream I have, I always wonder « how to make that dream come true ? ». By being true myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to share this piece of personal knowledge I've built through failures, suffering and loneliness.Until I let it all go and started building happiness on my own... which actually led me to meet my current husband. It was nine years ago, and I couldn't be more at peace, and still learn huge lessons from this relationship about what it is, to be a human.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When love is not anymore - or not yet - in our lives, feelings go from sadness to anger, and at times, it&amp;#39;s a simple, plain, and endless emptiness.

&lt;p&gt;Now, like in any storytelling, you know hardship is to come when the tone gets tense and anxious. That&amp;#39;s exactly what many of us do, when launching a quest for love. Love becomes the big deal, and our surroundings become dungeons we&amp;#39;re afraid &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; excited to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some of you, dear readers, will argue that you don&amp;#39;t do that, and basically just keep an open eye until something happens. I would argue back that you most probably are just like a lion sleeping ; comes the time when somebody catches your eye, and that person will become your quest, am I right ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear me attentively : It&amp;#39;s the quest that makes the dragon. Building up tension about a potential mate, about a potentiel encounter, about that already special someone, stressing about how you&amp;#39;re dressed, is your job good enough, will you still be free if it works, will the sex be good happily after ever... Whatever. You&amp;#39;re just building up tension. That&amp;#39;s how you let yourself be burried into great illusions and fears, and end up acting like somebody you think you should be and picking up partners that you think you should pick, because you don&amp;#39;t have a choice or else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop, just stop putting on love the responsibility of the disappointments and failures that follows. « Why can&amp;#39;t I be in love ? Why he/she can&amp;#39;t be in love with me ? Why our love has end ? » you ask yourself often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh love, it doesn&amp;#39;t make anybody blind : it makes you see the true beauty of somebody else.Love never suddenly stops. Love never suddenly happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passion, on the other hand, which is like a beautiful cristal made out of pure tension, it will turn your head, blind your eyes and yes, your heart. It can hit you in the fraction of a second, as you accidentally touches someones hand, see a strikingly beautiful face or just had smell the most attractive pheromons ever. Because passion depends deeply on your inner stories, physiological and psychological reflexes, passion feels like you’re in touch with your soul. Which is true. But that is absolutely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what love is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passion is about yourself and how you can feel alive and true.Love is about someone else and how you can live truthfully with that person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I know the sweet feeling of growing dreams of romance. It&amp;#39;s just that you want your dreams to become a tangible, long lasting love. And so do I. With every dream I have, I always wonder « how to make that dream come true ? ». By being true myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share this piece of personal knowledge I&amp;#39;ve built through failures, suffering and loneliness.Until I let it all go and started building happiness on my own... which actually led me to meet my current husband. It was nine years ago, and I couldn&amp;#39;t be more at peace, and still learn huge lessons from this relationship about what it is, to be a human.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a bit all over the place sorry and my love is making my thoughts dart around as I try to recount our wonderful love story. 

TL/DR : I met the love of my life and most beautiful woman I have ever seen on reddit starting as an anonymous person and she is 20 years older than me and it is the perfect relationship and love bears no age or barriers. I love you bby. 

18 months ago I was working a corporate job a significant medical event happened in my life. When I recovered I realised that I couldn’t give a fuck about the mortgage the kids the career because what’s the fucking point I mean I feel lucky it happened to me because I’m truely free of the burden other people are enslaved to for their entire lives however because I had a little bit of a past that was well behind me I was down to 1 friend left. I knew this guy was a dog but I had a huge history with him. I decided to move to another state and city and left within 2 weeks of my decision. I had cash in the bank and I found a place and knew I had a long time before I had to find a job. I knew no one here at all and wasn’t working or looking for employment so my only contact to the outside world was this friend. One day he just stops replying to my messages and I know him well deep down he would expect me to chase him because he is deeply disturbed and I just said fuck this idiot and cut him off. 

I never really felt lonely however I was feeling s growing insanity because of lack of human interaction past speaking to someone at the grocery store etc. 

So I turned to reddit. I had seen it regularly before when googling various topics and somehow stumbled on and I made an account which actually eventuated became a famous account. 

During this time it was the dead of winter, I wasn’t working and I stayed at home slamming donuts and whatever else I could with the shades drawn literally spending the entire day on reddit. It was my darkest hours. I’ve never been like that before you know actually seeking out human contact. So this profile kept popping up on my comments and I would pop up on their posts in a totally like plutonic joking manner nothing to it. I can’t remember what exactly pushed me to do it but I was in fear of her changing accounts or something. I really don’t know but I shot her a reddit message which was slow at first and we went back and forth over a few days until went onto chat and meanwhile we were keeping our own alts up you know not giving real information etc. because the chatting was getting ever increasing and reddit chat was slow we both moved to fake accounts on a social media platform. 

As soon as we got to social media we started talking 16 hours a day here is the plot twist. We are 12 hours time zones apart and she is one of the few remaining toll booth attendants in the country working 3rd shift. I unemployed was available all day to message her while she sat there waiting for the odd car to pass.

We exchanged photographs and to my surprise she was so beautiful yet 20 years my senior. I am late 20s she is late 40s. We had a fight early on in our relationship which nearly ended it and I remember thinking this is my chance to get rid of her this is wrong she is 14000 miles away and 20 years older than me. 

I couldn’t stay away I made a new fake account and added her again as she blocked me. Later I found out she woke up and the first thing she did was unblock me but she was so happy to see my new account pop up. 

Right then we found out we were in love even before we went to the real life social media platform. Since then we have talked 16-20 hours a day all day everyday. We were together for 6 months and built up to videos but never actually talked on the phone live or on video chat ever. 

Next. She books flights here. She arrives in my country (1st world western to 1st world western)  without ever speaking to me on the phone. Strangely this doesn’t phase either of us because our love is so pure that we at this point don’t care. We just need to have intimate sex and lay together because we know what is inside eachother mind and would have agreed to sit in other rooms texting if we had to end just lay with our body’s together to be together. 

When I rolled up she was more beautiful in real life than she was on message. As soon as we met it was exactly the same as message. When I got her in the car it was surreal but it was surreal how normal and real it was as soon as we exchanged a few words. 

We got home and went straight to the bedroom for the most amazing and passionate sex I have ever had in my life. I as a male came 3 times without losing my erection and she also came about the same amount. 

It only got better!!!!! As soon as we started conversing. We got on better in real life better in real life!!! I didn’t know I could love her more than I did before I met her but every single day we fell in love again and and again more than the day before and we had sex more than 50 times within two weeks. The most amazing sex we have ever had from passionate, to making love to kinky. We have it all. We are compatible in every single way possible. When she left my heart was broken when I couldn’t speak to her on the plane. We were nervous it would not go back to normal like it was but our love only grew stronger each and everyday. We now video chat and speak on the phone everyday in addition to messaging 16 hours a day. Fast forward to 6 1/2 days since she left my country. I book my flights to hers. It took less than a week for me to have to run back to her and now we are planning our next trip and my first trip to her country which was been a dream of mine my entire life. I asked her to marry me over a few weeks I guess we just somehow eased into it lol. So as I sit and write this my fiancé is blowing me up and I’m beaming with happiness. I am flying to her country in a couple months and after I come back we will save all our money for our marriage and close the gap.

So I have an “ex” let’s call him Ahmed for now. He’s from Morocco and we started talking 2016. We talked for a few months and he fell madly in love with me. I also loved him but not nearly as much as he loved me. I sent him a written letter telling him how I love him etc.(will be a detail later). He told me he wanted to marry me then and I agreed. Time passed and I started realizing this was just a fairytale because I was only 17 at the time and he lived across the damn world so I cut things off with him. It hurt us both really badly and he couldn’t get over it. I started a new relationship with a college boy (because I went off to college) and that lasted around 2 years but I noticed myself always thinking about Ahmed here and there. Fast forward to winter 2018 and I was really bored during winter break so I decided to make an account on an international dating site. I saw a really cute Moroccan guy (yes I have a thing for Moroccans lol) and matched with him immediately. Let’s call this guy Yousef. Yousef is my dream guy looks wise. He’s skinny, olive skin tone, big nose, big brown eyes and has a killer smile. I talked with him for a little and he told me he doesn’t speak French or English. I asked why and he said he was too lazy to learn. I was immediately turned off by that because I expected him to know French and for him to tell me it’s because he’s lazy was not good. So I started being petty to him (idk why I know I’m a bitch). I didn’t talk to Yousef for a few months until I got bored again which was last April. We exchanged WhatsApp’s and things got a little serious. I got to know him better and we spoke about religion and other stuff all the time and every day. I flirted with him a lot and he flirted back with me a little bit. Then one day, Yousef asks me if I want to be in a serious relationship with him and it took me by surprise. He told me he wants to know me better so he can marry me. I asked him so many questions such as “will you force me to convert to Islam etc etc” and I accepted all his answers. He then started talking every single day and I was falling hard for him. But then, Ahmed resurfaces yet again. Mind you, he would always pop up in my messages from time to time. Ahmed is my dream guy personality wise but not so much looks wise. Yes he has that Moroccan look that I like but I don’t like his nose or his teeth. I know it’s mean but it’s the truth. However, Ahmed is the sweetest person I have ever met on this planet. We video chatted a few weeks ago for the first time and he’s more attractive in person than I imaged. Oh by the way, he speaks English and French enough for us to communicate smoothly but we often code switch. He started telling me things like “I love you so much and I miss you etc. etc.” I immediately felt feelings rushing back and when he asked me if I loved him I told him only a little. Then yesterday happened when me and Ahmed video chatted for 3 hours. I asked him why does he still love me after all this time despite me being in another relationship and why he didn’t get a new girlfriend. He told me “because you still dwell in my heart” and I felt my stomach churn. He took out the letter that I sent him years ago and I felt like my intestines fell. He asked me why I only love him a little and I started crying and telling him I still love him. The morning happened and I was getting ready for school when he called to video chat. We chatted for an hour and a half and I came late to school. He then told me he wants to marry me, that I’m his angel and his queen, that he wants his children to be under my feet (it’s translated weird but in Arabic that means SO MUCH). And I agreed to marry him. Honestly though, what guy does this? This is rare asf to find in this world. But on the other hand, Yousef is there too and I really like him. We video chatted today and it felt really good. I like the topics we talk about because I am attracted to intelligence and whenever he smiles my heart melts. With Ahmed, he’s so sweet and romantic but I try talking about religion with him and he gets a little uncomfortable. I just don’t know what to do. I am so lost and I feel like Ahmed is the one but I feel bad leaving Yousef but I also don’t want to lead him on.

Ahmed is my dream guy personality wise but not so much looks wise. Yes he has that Moroccan look that I like but I don’t like his nose or his teeth. I know it’s mean but it’s the truth. However, Ahmed is the sweetest person I have ever met on this planet. We video chatted a few weeks ago for the first time and he’s more attractive in person than I imaged. Oh by the way, he speaks English and French enough for us to communicate smoothly but we often code switch. He started telling me things like “I love you so much and I miss you etc. etc.” I immediately felt feelings rushing back and when he asked me if I loved him I told him only a little. Then yesterday happened when me and Ahmed video chatted for 3 hours. I asked him why does he still love me after all this time despite me being in another relationship and why he didn’t get a new girlfriend. He told me “because you still dwell in my heart” and I felt my stomach churn. He took out the letter that I sent him years ago and I felt like my intestines fell. He asked me why I only love him a little and I started crying and telling him I still love him. The morning happened and I was getting ready for school when he called to video chat. We chatted for an hour and a half and I came late to school. He then told me he wants to marry me, that I’m his angel and his queen, that he wants his children to be under my feet (it’s translated weird but in Arabic that means SO MUCH). And I agreed to marry him. Honestly though, what guy does this? This is rare asf to find in this world. But on the other hand, Yousef is there too and I really like him. We video chatted today and it felt really good. I like the topics we talk about because I am attracted to intelligence and whenever he smiles my heart melts. With Ahmed, he’s so sweet and romantic but I try talking about religion with him and he gets a little uncomfortable. I just don’t know what to do. I am so lost and I feel like Ahmed is the one but I feel bad leaving Yousef but I also don’t want to lead him on. Please help.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s customary to hug people farewell in my country,” Nath stated.

“Alright,” she responded warmly, moving very close to him.

He smelled her musk again. It filled his head with a sensation he could not describe. Maybe, it was the lust sensation he heard about from his friends. She moved her supple small body even closer, until her large round breasts were touching his lower chest. She was almost a foot smaller than him, so he had to bend over to hug her, but when he did, his body felt like it was lit on fire. Her breasts squished against his chest, his hands reached over her shoulders enveloping her hair, her soft arms and her head rested on his chest naturally. His chin followed by resting on her head. Warmth spread rapidly throughout his body, energizing his emotions, his thoughts and of course, his penis. It stiffened unbelievably hard, like steel.

She moved her face upwards and stared at his lips. He kissed her sweet mouth again, tasting her. He darted his tongue inside again briefly, enjoying her honey sweetness. He held his hands across her shoulders still, keeping her body close to him. He was surprised when she began sucking on his lower lip. He groaned.

“Mmm, did that feel good?” she murmured.

“Yea,” he moaned.

“Okay, I will do that again,” she grinned, then sucked on his bottom lip again, feeling his body shudder in her grasp. “Interesting,” she smiled and then continued kissing him. She moved a small hand over his penis. “Can I feel it?”

“Yea,” Nath replied, simply. He began to get a curious brain fog, like he wasn’t sure what words to say anymore.

Her small hand landed on his groin. Through his pants, she felt his penis, running her fingers curiously over the hard, long shaft. “Hmm, interesting,” she commented. “Is it always this big?”

He chuckled. “No.”

She curled her fingers around his penis and grabbed it lightly.

Nath stiffened.

“Oh? Did I do something wrong?” she asked.

“No, you did nothing wrong” Nath said, as he pulled away a bit. “But, I can’t do that for very long. I will lose control.”

“Oh? Okay, I won’t grab it.”

“Yea,” Nath chuckled. “No grabbing, not yet anyways.”

“Alright,” she replied, pulling away. She kissed his mouth again, briefly, pecking his mouth with little kisses. “I should go. You look hungry. Eat that fish and catch some more in the morning.”

He released her from the embrace and felt a drift of cold air where her body was previously. She turned and bent over her fishing box, packing everything up.

She stood and turned to him. “I had a very wonderful time fishing with you, Nath. You are a very warm, gentle man.”

“I would like to see you again, Anwa,” he asked, gently.

“Yes, I can show you how to hunt for deer, next time,” she smiled warmly.

“I would love that,” Nath replied.

“Ok, well, see you later, then,” she smiled and picked up her fishing box, walking away briskly, with a little spring in her gate.

Nath watched her walk away into the forest. She turned back and waved happily. “Bye, Nathanael!”

He smiled broadly, waving back enthusiastically. “Bye, bye, Anwa!”

This happened nearly 3 years ago. My boyfriend and I had been dating for about 2 months and hadn’t really gotten serious yet. On this particular night, I stayed over at his place and we happily engaged in our favorite activity. The morning after seemed like any other as we lay in each other's arms. When I finally got up, I gasped. His bed sheet looked like a crime scene. I'll spare you the gory details, but it wasn't pretty.

Needless to say, I was embarrassed. Really embarrassed. This had never happened to me before as my cycle is quite regular. But this time Aunt Flo decided to crash the party.

My boyfriend, however, was unfazed. He just asked if I was feeling OK. He could sense my awkwardness and told me it was not a big deal. ""It's just a sheet"", he said.

I felt relieved and decided to head for the shower. I looked into my purse for sanitary pads as I always have a couple in there. But, as it turned out, my woes weren’t about to end anytime soon. I had no pads. I stood there trying to figure out how I’m supposed to go out to get them with my red flower in full bloom. Oh and icing on the cake, I had white trousers.

As I cursed myself for not carrying pads the one time I needed them, he again asked if I was okay. I told him about my predicament.

Without missing a beat he said “go take a shower, I’ll get them for you”. He quickly got dressed and was out the door in a minute. When I came out of the bathroom, there was a pack of sanitary pads waiting for me on the bed. I thanked him and he again told me it wasn’t a big deal.

This was the first of many instances where he touched my heart. This may not seem like such a big deal, but his thoughtfulness and complete lack of quandary in a situation that would have thrown off so many guys, told a lot about the kind of man he really is.

On the other hand, I was the 'one of the boys' type of girl, so basically we got along well, not just super close.

Since mid-year last year tho, we have gotten a lot closer because he started to follow this kpop girl group and I am the greatest kpop fan he has ever met. So, we chatted about kpop, texted and stuff. During this time, I also knew he was head over heels in love with this other girl for I don't know how long. But ultimately, this girl started dating this other dude so he kind of stepped away from that scene.

2 months ago, he confessed to me that he liked me. And that he has been liking for a long time, he just didn't want to admit because his friend was courting me for a loooong time, and that he wants to protect me and care for me and whatnot.

Ultimately, I told him that I liked him too. 

So we started hanging out and stuff. We even went 2nd base already. But now, 2 months later, we don't even chat anymore. Although I do text him and stuff but he doesn't reply the same way he did days after his stupid confession.

I feel like he's going to ghost on me coz tbh, i am such a downgrade from his latest love. And i think i'm in trouble because i might have fallen too deep too fast this time. 

Do you think it's too early to stop and wait a couple more days or weeks or months for him to prove himself or...

So, my boyfriend and I have been together for six months. I know, not a long time, but he has already shown that he is definitely a keeper. Two main events come to mind: the first, back in February, there was a situation with my drunk mom where she ended up hitting me in the face and leaving me at the airport alone in the middle of the night. I called him in tears and said that she had hit me, and I could tell he was absolutely furious at her for doing such a thing. He didn't care that it was 1 am and that he had work the next day, he dropped what he was doing and immediately came to get me. He even took the next day off of work because I was really shaken up (I come from an abusive household) and he wanted to make sure that I was okay.

The next one happened just yesterday. I'm a ftm trans guy who has been taking hormones for two and a half years and I have been struggling to afford surgery for my chest. I had been waiting for a surgery grant to open so I could apply, but after waiting months for this grant I found out that it wouldn't work for me. He came home to me and did everything he could to help cheer me up, then surprised me and said he was going to apply for CareCredit and help me get it done. He got approved, and now all I need to do is call the surgery center and get things set up.

&lt;p&gt;So, my boyfriend and I have been together for six months. I know, not a long time, but he has already shown that he is definitely a keeper. Two main events come to mind: the first, back in February, there was a situation with my drunk mom where she ended up hitting me in the face and leaving me at the airport alone in the middle of the night. I called him in tears and said that she had hit me, and I could tell he was absolutely furious at her for doing such a thing. He didn&amp;#39;t care that it was 1 am and that he had work the next day, he dropped what he was doing and immediately came to get me. He even took the next day off of work because I was really shaken up (I come from an abusive household) and he wanted to make sure that I was okay.&lt;/p&gt;

So i go into the class and im not the only new person i see the other person was a girl at the moment i saw her i was interestet but i still had a litte crush on a girl from my old class.

Soon we began to talk witch only increased my interest in here at the end of the fist day we had become friends and Exchanged numbers And We texted a LOT. 
 
After some days i just asked here what should i do about my crush from my old class (ldk why i asked here )  and we talked, the school day ends and i go home and I say my old chrush that i love here. I didn't get any response for almost a week it was pain and only pain, infact my best friend didn't want to see me suffer any longer and took the matter in his own hands, i got rejected very hard but i got over it, by instantly getting a very hard chrush on the new girl.

Some months passed and i decided too try it again and i told here that i love here she did kind of rejected me but in a very kind way by saying that she doesn't want a relationship at the moment because she had here own problems and first wanted to solve them.

I answered with the words I can wait

I was really happy for the first time in my live 

She solved here problems and is since the end of January again in a relationship but my love nevet went away and she knows that and is sorry for that i have fallen in love with her and now only suffer in pain, i always responded with you don't have to be sorry it's Ok even though i knew that i fellt the pain and i am still felling it but i still love her with every centimetre of my body.

I have no words to describe how amazing this man is to me…
I love him so much. The respect he shows me, the connection we’ve developed over the past few months leaves me speechless. From his gift giving, to his small gestures, make me feel like I’m the luckiest lady on earth. 
He has made me so happy this year, I cannot express enough how much he has saved me and showed me how to trust again. 
He is the calm to my storm, he has a way of just calming me down, anytime something happens, he is my first thought. 
His commitment to me and calming ways just give me peace.
The thought of losing him after recent events, is something I cannot imagine and don’t want to. Taking on and fully accepting my responsibilities as his. The difficult situation I put him in and his willingness to stand by me. I was so scared it’d be too much for him. 
I sometimes think I’m in a fairytale and I never want it to end. 
I mean how is it possible for him to love me so much?
People like him don’t exist. 

His random hugs and his thoughtfulness,
Him offering his hands for me to step into, to tying my shoelaces, walking me back to my hotel at 10:30pm. Warming my hands up in his when I started shivering. How he looks at me, guides me and looks after me through the crowds. His concern when I had injured my foot and was limping. 
His effort travelling long distances from his home to mine only to spend a few hours with me. His support and understanding about the failures in my life and his encouragement to keep on going. 
His funny, warm, caring, beautiful soul and so so much more. 

Im going marry this guy soon, no way am I letting him go.

&lt;p&gt;During my depression, I didn&amp;#39;t tell anyone what I was going through. Not even her, my best friend. I sat alone in my agony for 5 months. Then when I realised I need help, I told her everything what I was going through and I need help. She started crying, and didn&amp;#39;t stop for a long time. I was crying as well. &lt;/p&gt;

The weirdest thing happened to me and I wish I could talk to you about it. But I don't think this is something I should talk ever talk to you about. So I don't know if this letter is even meant for you. I don't know. It's unsent anyway. 

So I went to have lunch with my sister yesterday in the 'Turkish' neighborhood. She needed something from a Turkish store so we went there first. There was this Turkish girl there who apparently my sister vaguely knows. A friend of a friend. So they started talking and I just stood there. Of course I noticed how pretty she was. Then she directly asked me ""So who are you?"". For *some reason*, my sister decided it was a great idea to ask Turkish Pretty Girl to come to lunch with us. So we had lunch and it was mostly awkward since my sister doesn't really know her that well, and I really didn't care. The only thing I remember is that she said that she works at the children's daycare around the corner, and she talked about oranges for some reason. She literally asked me if I like to eat oranges. 

I spend the rest of the day doing the usual, you know, casually being obsessed with you and missing you like crazy. I fell asleep looking at your/our pictures on my phone. But then this morning I woke up after having the weirdest fucking long-ass dream. No, not one of my nightmares, no panic attacks, a dream. So, yeah, basically Turkish Pretty Girl and I were madly in love. In my stupid dream she looked extra hot, and.. tall. For some reason she was tall. I even called her ""askim"". I remember the Turkish girls in high school would say that and it meant something like 'my love'. And in this dream I really felt like I loved her. So, yeah, that's weird. And I woke up still feeling in love for a minute. The fuck is wrong with me, Alessia?

**I think I know why I wrote this unsent letter to you. What I wish I could tell you is that maybe one day I could really fall in love with another girl. Maybe one day I will stop thinking about you and some other girl will be my love. I don't want that to happen cause I want you. But sometimes you can't control how your life turns out. I still hope my life turns out the right way. With you.**

**I love you, Alessia. You've got my heart, don't worry.**

My very first relationship was when I was too young (as in 5th grade, too young). This guy asked me out and I said yes. Sad part is that our families were close. I liked to draw at that time and I had this drawing hanging up by my bed. One day I had a party at my house and he came over. duh. He came to my room with his friends and he laughed my drawing. As soon as I heard that I was like “bitch I’m out.” What didn’t help was afterwards I heard him say that “he had steps in a relationship”. At the time I thought that that wasn’t natural and I just hated how there was STEPS. Like I don’t want steps, I just want to see how it goes. I felt that he would push things in order to get to those steps. Shortly after that I ended things with him. He did other things that I won’t mention but through the few days we were together, things started stacking up quickly and I knew this wasn’t for me.

So, am I traumatized after that? Or am I just not emotionally ready?

Love is freedom and I opt to give you the freedom to fly without my chains binding you. I want to release you from me.

I want you to grow in all aspects of your life possible – in your career, passion and dreams. I believe that you’ll make it big, in time. I want you to discover yourself, learn new things, go out of your comfort zone, gather experiences and unearth the secrets of life.

I'm currently in Junior year. 
Since I started High School, I had found myself completely twisted over a boy. But as every year went by I always used to forget all about him.

Finally, last year, I was back to watching him a lot at lunch and trying to catch eyes with him. I was catching feelings. 
Thing is, at those times, he had a girlfriend, who was really beautiful and had the greatest personality a guy could ever want. I was a bit mad that I didn't ever talk to him sooner but as some months went by, they had separated, and I somehow managed to start talking to this guy.

First month went pretty good, we chatted a lot, but I was the one who mostly started convos (he did start some as well, just not as much as I did because I'm the one who adores chatting with people in my interest 24/7. And he had also told me he preferred speaking to someone in person before chatting through phone, weirdly enough in the century we're in).
I think somewhere around that time we went out to a park and by the end of the day he ended up kissing me and I, as shy and immature as I was, cut the kiss halfway. I completely hate myself for doing that.
That day we also spoke about relationships and what we thought about It and he had told me he didn't really want to be in a relationship anymore because he knew he wouldn't be able to maintain It as he started Senior year. He knew he would be unloyal to them on that last year of High School. (He was a Junior last year, and I was a Sophomore.)

At school he would never make the energy to say hi to me, and If we'd find ourselves walking towards eachother in a hallway I'd always say hi first because he just never would.

Now, here starts the problem. Some months later of slowly chatting, I had invited him to my house to talk about life and idk what my idea was. We didn't have sex or anything in that matter, even If we were both sat on my bed, on the verge of actually doing something, nothing like that happened (I still wonder why he just didn't do anything If he knew what my feelings for him were. I was a virgin but still..).
Later that day, I got a bit depressed whilst he was still home. I felt weird because nothing had happened yet and I thought myself as a fraud.

Thing is, when I get sad, I like to show other people how hurt I am (I don't do It anymore, because I've learnt from that day.) I used to be a cutter, and what was my best idea? Showing him my scars. 
I gave him my arm so he could touch them and I could see some pity in his eyes (I raved to see other people pity me, I was and am still completely psychotic) and I don't really remember what he had said. I have no clear remind of that time. I just know I said that cutting was really addictive and THAT ONE DAY I WOULD SHOW HIM HOW CUTTING WORKED. As in, I wanted to show him how I cut myself. I don't know what was really going on inside my head, but I regret this so much. (If you need to know, I'm completely clean from cutting now, gladly.)
After, he stayed 'till night and ate at my house, and as he left he also didn't give me any affection, just a cheek-cheek kiss as we do in my country.

After that day, I think like a week after, I was regretting showing him my wrists, so I cut myself as I cried and somehow ended up sending him a picture of the cuts minutes after to.. I don't know.. spread the pain? I don't know why I was so dumb, really. I hated myself for showing him my wrist but I still sent him a picture of It? I wasn't feeling well but I realize now that showing something like that to him, without even knowing him that long, wasn't really the right choice.

After some weeks of chatting he got back with his last ex (the beautiful lovely girl I stated before) and we hadn't spoken anymore. I got mad because he completely cut off our chat, so I wanted to kiss one of his friends but his friend rejected me all at once and that's when I came to feel worse.

Some weeks passed and I felt like I had annoyed him all that time we talked (because I felt like I had forced him to talk to me) and apologized to him through message. He said everything was completely fine, and used one of my nicknames I had told him I mostly liked. 

After that we never spoke again. It was all like nothing ever really happened with the dude.
Now I completely regret everything I told him and want to take It back but I know It's too late.
Every time I look at him I just remember about all this that happened and how he knows that I used to do those types of things. I don't even know if his friends know about It. I just know they all hate me. Or they think that I'm an immature f*ckup.
These days at lunch we cross one another and It feels as If we've never knew eachother. It feels like we're total strangers.
I regret everything, and I still keep fantasizing on being in a relationship with him. But, after all that... I don't see It happening.

It was love at first sight. By our third date we told each other that we didn’t know what was happening but that it just felt so right. We fell into a relationship, so quickly and deeply. I had just come out of the worst year and a half of my life where I was cheated on and lied to and I was learning to respect myself again. 

You were kind, you loved me. You cuddled me as I fell asleep and kissed me gently. You made me feel comfortable in my skin which I had never felt. I was taught that I wasn’t worth much, that I would never be able to be loved the way I loved others. That wasn’t true. You loved me. Fuck you loved me and you still do. Smoking cigarettes after sex at your window, the cold breeze. I felt comfortable walking around naked with you. It sounds stupid but I never did with anyone else.

Time flies, a year turns into two. You tell me you love me so much, we argue sometimes but we cry and make up. You have NEVER hurt me once, you only brought me joy and happiness. You were so understanding, sometimes we didn’t see each other for a week because I had too much work and you were fine with that. You accepted that I had a weird thing about friends and family and that it would take a long time for you to become part of that sphere. I’ve been hurt, I’m scared to be honest a lot of the time. My therapist says I’ve got issues with people because I’ve always just been me, defending myself. 

This bothered you but you never said anything. I wanted to give it all to you, I kept telling you that I was going to change because I DO love you and you deserve it all. You gave me everything. Fuck I miss your kisses in bed and the way you’d snuggle up to me. I miss your dinners, I miss the shows we’d watch. I miss our walks and I miss our joking around. I miss the shower sex and to be honest I really miss my best friend.

But my love, I promised and promised and I couldn’t give it to you. I ended up telling you I just couldn’t change. I tried to change for you but I found it too hard to let you become part of my family, of my various friend groups that I ensure to keep apart because I’m fucked up in the head and I try and control everything in my life. I couldn’t make you as happy as I had wanted so we decided to say goodbye.

You know what the worst part is? You fucking understand and that you just want me to get better. You’re so stupid, you’re even taking my side on this one... you’re just so stupidly fucking perfect and I know I need to let you go because I’ll hurt you. I’ll hurt you like I’ve hurt everyone else in the past. I need to figure myself out and I don’t want you to be part of that process, because as much as you think you want to be by my side through this, you’ll hurt.

You’re young. I was your first. Go out and kiss some boys, be silly and don’t worry about me and my work. Don’t worry about my tears. I want you to live your best life, I want you to just be ok. Be that artist my love, smile more and love your perfect body. You’re the sexiest woman I’ve ever seen. 

I wish I could have been ‘him’, but I failed you. I know we thought this was forever and I’m sorry. Ill try not to call so as to make things easier for you.

To start from the beginning; I met him on a blind date.. With a twist! My sister and I were part of a Pokemon TCG group in our city and we had a sushi meet, my sister met someone (Ty) whom she thought was my type and set it up as a group date. In my sisters car, on the way to the restaurant, we picked him up (Ty) and one other (Cole)- Ty was cute but not exactly my type, Cole however, I instantly felt something. We didn't talk and I more so casually spoke to Ty but Cole and I had serious unsaid chemistry. He later admitted to feeling the same.


 We get to the place and there are only 3 seats left after my sister and friends sit down - 2 beside eachother and 1 at the end of the table. I sat in 1 of the 2 seats and Cole bolted for the seat beside me unexpectedly and sat down, Ty did seem surprised but went to the end seat and spoke with his friends. Cole and I instantly hit it off when he started talking about interests; video games, horror buffs, same youtube subs, same books, anime, and of course cards -magic, pokemon, weiss etc.

We clicked and courted for a good while before becoming official. I still love him just as much if not more than when we met. He's been a source of light in my life. 

On to the post; I have been dealing with large bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts and actions. He has known this since the beginning and has never dimmed the lights on his empathy and care towards me. He ALWAYS puts me first and it's crushing me with gratitude. I have had a rough last few years wherein he did not have a job or had part time and I was supporting him financially while we live together, he had never had a full time job since we've been together (no blame to him) but the stress of my work and taking care of our pets, and cleaning the home and cooking became too much this past year due to family and medical issues atop this. He finally managed to get a full time job and insisted on taking care of me, he begged me to quit my job to take time for myself so I could go back to school and finally graduate highschool and start my career. He will not let me get a part-time job as he wants me to relax a few months with my free time with the time between school- I told him I would be essentially a housewife for the time being as I hate sitting around doing nothing- he again said even if I wanted to be a lazy couch potato he wouldn't mind after the years of ""horror"" I had to endure and he felt horrible for not being able to support me. 


I fucking love this man. I want to be with him the rest of my life, I have never met anyone this empathetic and caring to my needs and I love him greatly. I'm crying just posting this. He has helped my mental state so much and pushed me to improve in the most positive of ways. 

Cole, you are the brightest part of my life and have lifted me so high from where I started. I am indebted to you and the love you give me. I will return the same love by being the best I can be and the best for us.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely cliche post but I am so glad that this is the person I met almost 6 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We clicked and courted for a good while before becoming official. I still love him just as much if not more than when we met. He&amp;#39;s been a source of light in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the post; I have been dealing with large bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts and actions. He has known this since the beginning and has never dimmed the lights on his empathy and care towards me. He ALWAYS puts me first and it&amp;#39;s crushing me with gratitude. I have had a rough last few years wherein he did not have a job or had part time and I was supporting him financially while we live together, he had never had a full time job since we&amp;#39;ve been together (no blame to him) but the stress of my work and taking care of our pets, and cleaning the home and cooking became too much this past year due to family and medical issues atop this. He finally managed to get a full time job and insisted on taking care of me, he begged me to quit my job to take time for myself so I could go back to school and finally graduate highschool and start my career. He will not let me get a part-time job as he wants me to relax a few months with my free time with the time between school- I told him I would be essentially a housewife for the time being as I hate sitting around doing nothing- he again said even if I wanted to be a lazy couch potato he wouldn&amp;#39;t mind after the years of &amp;quot;horror&amp;quot; I had to endure and he felt horrible for not being able to support me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fucking love this man. I want to be with him the rest of my life, I have never met anyone this empathetic and caring to my needs and I love him greatly. I&amp;#39;m crying just posting this. He has helped my mental state so much and pushed me to improve in the most positive of ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cole, you are the brightest part of my life and have lifted me so high from where I started. I am indebted to you and the love you give me. I will return the same love by being the best I can be and the best for us.&lt;/p&gt;

     How are you doing my love? 

      I dont know whether this is just another sleepless night's effect, or if its a hormonal unbalance, or if it's really what i'm feeling. But i miss you. I miss laughing with you. I miss sleeping next to you. I miss cuddling with you. I miss your stupid jokes. I miss getting to know your beautiful mind. I miss the good days when everything fell right into place and it all made sense. I miss the connection we had. I miss the nights we'd spend singing Bohemian Rhapsody.   I miss the good times, you know? 

      We've broken up almost a year ago. Time flew by so fast because it seems to me like it was only yesterday. You might not even be the same person i fell in love with. And you might still be that exact person. Either ways it doesnt change anything. I still dont want to be in a relationship. And i definitely dont wanna go back to that hell where we drove each other insane. That relationship made me really sick. It was really toxic. We mistreated each other. Hurt each other over and over again. I never want to feel that way again.  I still remember some of the things that you did or said. They still hurt. 

       There are times when i can say for sure that i have gotten over you, but  sometimes i think abt you. You're often on my mind. I wonder how you're doing, reminisce over what we shared and what we've been through. It makes me not want to be your girlfriend because even though you are still really special to me, i just can't put myself through that pain again. I learned to love myself, and i think i'm still in love with you.

        I don't know what to do with that. 

        I think I've learned to live with it, you know? But It's stopping me from finding someone else who won't waste my time. I've tried to be with other guys. I have been with other guys. I gave them, and myself, a chance but my feelings never evolved. A simple crush at most. The moment things start to feel serious, i shut down and call the whole thing off. I really cant trust or love again. And i'm still really scared to go through another heartbreak. 

        I think it's because i still love you, somewhere deep down. Why tho? You were horrible to me. You're kindhearted, sweet, incredibly smart and talented, but you're also young, stubborn, prideful and very selfish And you treated me like I'm trash. I don't blame you though. If you hadn't put me through that, i would've never found my true strength. I told you the last time we met that of all the things i am grateful for, the one thing i am most grateful for is you breaking up with me. It set me free and opened my eyes to a wonderfully joyfull world that was right in front my eyes, all this time, i just couldn't see it. Not until I hit rock bottom. 

         I dont want to feel like how you've made me feel when we were together because it nearly destroyed me. I deserve much better than that. And I've been doing so well without all that drama. But i don't know what to do. There are times where i just wanna tell u that I'm still in love with you, but then i remember all the arguments and the times i felt my heart shatter into a million pieces and i ask myself, Do you really want to put yourself through literal pain again? 
 
        Maybe in another life, we could make it work. We could have more good days than bad ones. Because i really believe we would've been great together if we wanted the same things. But until then, know that i will always care for you, and love you. Come what may.

                                                        -With love, Your ex.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey,&lt;/p&gt;

    Maybe in another life, we could make it work. We could have more good days than bad ones. Because i really believe we would&amp;#39;ve been great together if we wanted the same things. But until then, know that i will always care for you, and love you. Come what may.

                                                    -With love, Your ex.

I don't really know whether this is the right subreddit to telling this.

I'm going into detail as I need your help. Maybe it's not only about the cheating buy our relationship. Thank you for your time.

I met her in late 2017 when she moved in the same building. We started dating quite quickly but I really fell in love with her. Soon after she had to move out because her flatmate was being rude since she started seeing me and after 2 months only we moved together.
The two of us are both kind of troubled. She, her ex-boyfriend, 2 years of self loathing and moving to another country (she's British, I'm German) and before we met she must have had a hard time. Cocaine frenzies and I don't know what. 
I am lacking big amounts of self confidence and trust in my abilities and I am generally struggling with life at work e.g. (I guess there's some ADHD and I need therapy).
Well I never cared about her past, she's a beautiful girl. Although she changed due to her stress. Before I wouldn't have talked to her.
Anyways...we started living together for a year and it was a fucking up and down. It was horrible. We were getting into physical fights. She hit me fist in the face. I also hit her. We were horrible.
Reason is...she never learned to understand that I really love her. She couldn't believe. And therefore she kept me distant when I gave it all. 
I didn't feel good anymore and maybe most say I should have ended it. Maybe. But I always knew that she wasn't ok.
I always knew that I love her.
As we were both living abroad she eventually told me that she needs to stay at home. 
I had spent 5 years abroad and didn't see any perspective there so I moved back to Germany.
Things got better. She's working home office so she can come over whenever.
Last time with me she had to endure a falling out between me and my family. Which made it hard for her to enjoy anything.
Well, on may 3rd I brought her to the airport as she had a team meeting with her company in France.
The weekend she went home before. 
I knew that she was going to a party.
While she was staying in France I had this odd feeling given the weird and scarce messages.
Yesterday at work she called me...told me she had to confess something.
It didn't come over her lips so I said what she was about saying. If it couldn't have been any worse...it was alcohol, coke and her ex-boyfriend.
She said she barley remembers and that she could only think about where this guy has been everywhere before (she's getting tested). 
I haven't seen her so truly down in a while. She's crying, hating herself and wants me to leave her. And not. She said it was because of all the stress, the worries and arguements, also the situation at my place. She sought relief in taking the cocaine. What she didn't know was that that the guy was last minute inviting himself to the place she stayed (it's all mutual friends). I don't know what happened there. And how. All I know is she is swearing that she ran away crying just after. I know her that much to believe it. 
I trust her. He just used her situation. Although I'm not excusing it. 

I am a fool and romantic (let aside my dark side, my violent side. I know I need therapy) and I love her so much. I've told her the deepest worries of myself, my most private thoughts. She loves me to bits but struggles with believing in us. In herself. She's not sure whether she wants to live in Germany although she likes it and our particular habits (so she says).
I'd move to England in the blink of an eye yet I'm tied to a crucial 1 year contract in the field I studied for. After that my chances increase a lot to find work in the UK or wherever. 
So we have options.

But here I am. it hurts so much knowing. 
I don't know how to get images out of my head.
But I love her. She's unforgiving to herself. She's been forgiving me so much.
This time I need to be strong and show her that I can forgive, too.
It's just a different level. Or not. 
I can't think of throwing it all away because of that. It was not cheating for the heck of it. She actually humiliated herself and is furious about it.

What I don't know is what's coming next. She's going to fly in soon.
I'm afraid. I want to be with her so much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys.

You're so smart and talented and you're good at everything you do. I am the luckiest girl in the world, I am still in awe that I get to call myself your girlfriend and I wouldn't trade what we have for anything in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Two former US Army soldiers tied the knot on the Q train over the weekend — and told The Post they chose the line for its stunning skyline views.

&amp;#x200B;

Manhattan residents Robert Musso, 30, and Francis Denmark, 32, exchanged “I Do’s” Saturday evening as the train crossed the Manhattan Bridge.

&amp;#x200B;

“I was mesmerized,” the Georgia-born bride said. “Speechless as I walked on . . . While I was saying my vows, behind him was the bridge and the water.”

&amp;#x200B;

But Denmark, a special-education graduate student at New York University, wasn’t always sold on the off-the-rails locale.

&amp;#x200B;

“At first I was skeptical,” she said. “When he mentioned it, \[my response was\] ‘No, it’s dirty and I’m not gonna do that.’”

&amp;#x200B;

But after a couple of days, “\[I thought\] it would be something unique and something different.

&amp;#x200B;

“So it’s not just a ceremony that you have to go through,” she said. “It was more an adventure for us.”

&amp;#x200B;

At around 5 p.m. Saturday, the groom, a consulting analyst, hopped on at the Prospect Park station with a wedding party of 10, plus a photographer and two assistants, to decorate the train car with flowers and garlands.

&amp;#x200B;

Clad in white, Denmark met up with the group, getting on the train at the Dekalb Avenue stop with her father and nephew.

&amp;#x200B;

There were no delays, though the bride said: “When we planned it, we knew anything could happen.”

&amp;#x200B;

One rowdy passenger did make a stink during the event.

&amp;#x200B;

“He was like, ‘You’re in my way, get out of my way,’” said Denmark. “He apologized afterwards once he realized what was going on.”

&amp;#x200B;

But other riders joined in on the fun, with one woman fixing the bride’s hair.

&amp;#x200B;

Musso’s sister-in-law, a retired judge, conducted the ceremony.

&amp;#x200B;

“We’re told this was a moving ceremony and the bride wore a beautiful train,” quipped MTA spokesman Shams Tarek. “President \[Andy\] Byford and the rest of Transit wish the happy couple all the best for the future — and thank them for their service.”

&amp;#x200B;

The couple, both Army captains, each did a tour in Afghanistan before they met in May 2016 at the Joint Base Lewis-McChord.

&amp;#x200B;

They are in the process of moving to Park Slope — where they’ll live off the Q Train.

&amp;#x200B;

“The subway, as much as it is maligned, it is still an integral part of the city. If it were to stop, the city would stop,” said Musso. “The MTA is like a marriage, they both need work, but they can both take you to beautiful places.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stand clear of the wedding ceremony, please!&lt;/p&gt;

This may be a bit of a sad one; but please feel free to share your experiences if you have any similar ones.

&amp;#x200B;

This January/last December, I met and became best friends with this guy. Instant connection, similar family backgrounds, struggles, worries, hobbies, etc. When we first started talking I knew I had a crush but my family assured me that it was all about proximity and shared trauma (sort of like ""hero worship""? ) and so I pushed the feelings aside. Maintained our friendship and it was amazing. So amazing. I had never  been more comfortable or happy with anyone else before and I was ecstatic just to have him in my life. That is, until I came to the \*late\* realization that all these complicated feelings I was having for him were, according to research and a trusted group of girl friends, **LOVE** (romantic and not platonic as I had initially thought). 

But around the time I finally understood my feelings I learned that he was in love with another girl. That he was going away on a holiday to spend time with her and her family and that his family adored her. I was, to put it simply, heartbroken. But he is my best friend and he is such an incredible person so he deserved her and to be so happy (I'd never seen him happier than when he told me they were officially a couple and how much he loved spending time with her). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I did the mature thing and said nothing, confided briefly in his sister (before he went on holiday and officially began dating the girl he loved) and decided to take some space and try to get back to just friends. To not ever divulge my feelings. And though it feels like the right decision (in the rational, selfless part of my mind) it still hurts like hell. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clarification: We are still friends but we talk far less frequently (maybe once a week vs. everyday before). What's most important to me is that he is happy, even though that happiness isn't from me

I cared for you more than you could ever know, even after i told you how i felt and you rejected me, i still felt the same way. Part of me thinks that i will always feel this way even a little, that you will always have a place in my heart and will be a part of me forever. Still not a day goes by when i don't think of you.

But i'm done being your friend and i'm done trying, the more i reflect on it you weren't there for me when i needed you, when you knew i needed you. I did everything i could to help you when you needed someone and you cannot say you did the same for me. 

You weren't there for me romantically, but i'm not angry and wouldn't change your decision for anything. I respect and understand how you feel and it would be worse for you to come with me if you didn't feel the same way. But you also weren't there for me as a friend and that's what bothers me. I've been through hell and more this last year and you know it, but you never made an effort. Never made an effort to see if i was okay or support me, and its fine, you didn't need to, but you've made it apparent where you stand. So, i'm done, i'm done. I'm going to go and find someone that can care and reciprocate, even if it takes years i really don't care. 

I'm done with being hurt, i am going to move on and i am going to succeed and do the other things. If you're not willing to take the risk that i was willing to, by telling you how i felt despite everything, then there is nothing more to say. I feel sad and drained, but i have closure, even if it is internal. I find it impossible to muster any kind of spite against you and i genuinely wish you all the best, but it is time for me to go.

It was a rare calm day. The lake looked like glass, only small ripples broke its surface. The gentle lapping was the only sounds he heard, except for the occasional eagle. He was amazed at the beauty of it all.

He noticed a slight movement at the edge of a group of rocks leading out into the water. A line flew out. Then it was slowly, but expertly, pulled back in. It was a fisherman’s line. And it was Anwa on the rocks.

His heart thumped in his chest and his palms began to sweat. Interesting, Nath thought, that I would have such a physical response to this woman.

He controlled his movements deliberately. He wanted to run over to her, hug her and say hi, but he knew that was inappropriate and would most probably scare her away too. So, he slowed his footsteps and sauntered over very casually.

She turned her head and waved with a friendly nod, but her eyes looked deeply into his, just for the briefest of moments. “Nath! Hi! Come, I can show you some fishing.” She patted the seat beside her, which was a flat large rock. “Be careful, the rocks can be slippery.”

Nathan walked onto the rocks and she looked up and again their eyes locked deeply. “Hi, Anwa. It is very nice meeting you again. I wanted to thank you for taking Jonasson to Winnipeg. With this loan, we can prosper.”

“No problem at all, Nath. It was my pleasure. Now sit.” She patted the rock again.

He took the offered seat and felt her warmth emanate from her. He caught a drift of that musky woman smell again. It made him smile.

“What are you smiling about?” Anwa laughed.

“Nothing, nothing,” Nath replied. “Show me how to catch these elusive lake fish.”

“The best fish here are called pickerel. We will try to catch some today.” She stood and handed him the rod. “Okay, you hold it like this.” She gripped his hands around the handle. Her sensual electricity shot through his hands and sent warm sensations throughout his body. He wanted to hug her and pull her close. But he did nothing of the sort. He followed her hands and held the fishing rod as instructed. He watched her eyes light up as she spoke of where to catch the fish, what fish is the best tasting, what each fish looks like, some roundish, some long and what time of day is best to catch fish.

“Early morning is best around these rocks. The lake is so calm in the mornings and the fish venture closer to shore when the sun rises,” she commented, motioned with her hands as if encompassing the entire lake.

“You love this,” He motioned with his hands.

“Yes, I do,” she replied. “The lake is in my blood. I  born here on this land and I feel part of the sea, too.” Her brown eyes sparkled with knowledge and passion. 

She smiled sweetly. 

He wanted to kiss her.

She immediately looked away, shyly.

“Why do you do that?” he asked.

“Do what?”

“Run away, look away, when I want to kiss you,” he replied.

She smiled and looked down. “Because I have never kissed a man before,” she replied. She darted a glance at him, then looked down again. “And I like you, Nath.”

Nath put the rod in his right hand and fluttered his fingers towards her chin. “You would be alright if I kissed you then,” he politely insinuated.

“Yes,” she continued looking down.

He lifted her chin. “You have beautiful eyes. You have a smouldering passion in your eyes. Its mesmerizing,” he said. 

She looked up at him, her eyes locking into his. And without another word, their lips met. She was moist and soft, her lips full and gentle. She instinctively opened her mouth and Nath fluttered his tongue at her opening. He kissed her lips softly again, then felt his tongue dart out into her mouth briefly again, tasting her honey mouth. He felt his groin harden quickly and uncomfortably. He shifted to the side, trying to adjust himself. 

She felt his uncomfortableness and broke the kiss. She looked down and saw the lump in his pants. “Does it hurt?” she asked.

He laughed. “No, it doesn’t hurt, just uncomfortable.”

“Why does it do this when you get close to me?”

“Because I have a very beautiful woman in my arms and my body notices,” he replied.

“Why does your body do this?”

He grinned. “Hmm, I’m not sure how to answer that in a gentlemanly way.”

“Please answer. I won’t be offended.”

“Well, a man’s penis hardens to get ready for sex. I believe it can’t enter a vagina otherwise. Although, I’m not 100% certain on that,” Nath answered.

“Why are you not certain?” she asked.

“Because I have not experienced sex yet,” he replied.

“Oh,” she paused. “I have never had sex either,” she said. Anwa gazed across the lake, thoughtfully. “Although, I’ve dreamed of having sex in the bushes. Many times.”

His penis hardened fully. His head felt light. Then the fishing rod tugged in his right hand. He was momentarily stunned, not sure what was going on. His brain was in his pants.

He said he does want to marry me!!! 
He’s even been thinking about it a lot lately, how, when, and where he’d do it, he was going to ask my Dad for permission but hasn’t been in the right mind set to work himself up for it yet. 
I told him ‘thank you, that’s literally all I wanted to hear, that I wasn’t just putting my all into our relationship for what felt like no reason’. (Which I know isn’t the case) 

But even just to hear that this man I plan on spending my life with, wants to do the same (yes I see the irony in having kids before knowing this) it was such a huge relief.
I’m just so happy. I don’t have to wonder anymore, I know it will happen one day, I know what his thoughts are on it, and I’m glad I finally grew some balls and told him where I was at.

Also, this is going to be very long, I have no one to gush to about all of this, so it's all coming out now in this post lol.  


We've known each other for a few years, I was in a relationship, he was always an innocent crush at a store I frequented around the corner from my work. When I broke up with my ex we hung out for the first time, without doing the ""I just need to buy something"" charade, we stayed up all night, ended up being around 18 hours together just hanging out and talking before I had to go to work. We said we would take it slow, I had just gotten out of a relationship and he had been single for a decade, we needed adjustment time... or so we thought.  


We have been joined a the hip (whenever possible) since. Thing is, I have never and I mean NEVER felt this way about someone before. I've loved, I've been loved, but this, this is far beyond that. I am generally a very insecure person about my appearance, but from the first day we spent time together I have never been more comfortable. Our ""arguments"" aren't even that. The last one was ""you should finish your pizza"" to which I replied ""I will, but you look really comfy and I don't want to move you"" he said ""but I know you like it when it's warm"" and I said ""Yes, but crispy will suffice, I don't want to move you"" and we decided to agree to disagree because as he said ""I don't want to argue right now I'm too comfortable"".  


Seems like a small anecdote but my last relationship if I ever brought up my feelings on any matter I would get screamed at and walls would be punched. I felt like I couldn't share my feelings at all in that relationship. In this one, it's a complete 180. If THAT is what he considers ""arguing"" I will argue with him till the end of time.   


And he does things, things anyone else doing them would drive me insane, but when it's him, it's actually relaxing. For example, snoring. Between him and my dog, it sounds like two semis in my room, very loud and consistent. However, between their snoring and the playlist we play before bed, I am the happiest in the world.  


I just have to say on top of that, I have severe insomnia, like a good night without sleep aids is an hour of sleep, 3 if I'm REALLY lucky. I get consistent solid sleep with just him and music. I've managed to try and simulate this when he isn't over, which he has been helping me with. He will sleep in my bed, but after we wake up he stays in it and kinda wriggles around, making sure his smell wears off onto my sheets. I know, I know, it sounds weird, but for whatever reason (I know the reason from a biological standpoint) he just smells SO good, without wearing anything, which is why I have very quickly stolen a couple shirts and sweaters. (I'm not a creep I swear, he's requested I do the same in his bed.... or maybe we're weird idk)

&amp;#x200B;

All of those things aside, I got out of an almost 5-year relationship recently (it was not a standard relationship, I was more like his mother/guardian than a partner), and we decided to hang out and just... never wanted to be apart after that. It wasn't planned, or expected, but omg is it so much different and so good.  


Things I didn't even know I wanted or would like he does. As I mentioned before we work right around the corner from each other. Our shifts aren't always on the same days, but we consistently have Saturdays on together. So on our breaks, we will walk around the corner and visit the other. Now I'm not the most touchy-feely person in the world, people at work refer to me as a robot for example, but when he walks in my shop, I can't help but smile. Doesn't matter what kind of day I'm having, as soon as I hear the door chime and his keys jingle, his signature ""Hullo"", I have a giant smile on my face. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've known him for almost 4 years, I met him because of my ex, I've been with him a month, and I want to marry this man. He is what I've been missing from my life for 25 years, he's what I didn't know was missing from my life for 25 years. He makes me feel so attractive, appreciated, interesting, unique, and most importantly, loved. He doesn't think he's doing a good job of showing his love and affection, but he couldn't be more wrong, and I've told him that, but only time will make him believe that one.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what else to say besides I love him, so much, to the degree where I thought I loved people in the past and I'm now realizing I was wrong. We get along so well on every level, there is so much chemistry between us, and I honestly can't think of something he could do (besides the big ones, i.e cheat) that would change the way I feel about him. Every day I fall deeper in love with him. When my ex found out I was seeing someone, he was my ex's first guess. Everyone around us knew this would happen, besides us.   


Which I never understood, we built our real ""first"" build PC's together (not in person but swapping specs and such), we discussed game preferences, he would stop into my store when he was off work and I would delay my visits to his store until I knew he was working, just so I could see him, whether he served me(talked) or not. I just wanted to see him as much as possible, and for him the same.   


I was with my ex for almost 5 years, we discussed marriage and living together, but did neither of those things because it never felt right. I've been with him for just barely over a month and we're already talking about house plans, living together, wedding, any hypothetical future plan you could think of (aliens included lol) has been discussed. The biggest thing with that, I'm actually super excited about it, and I cannot wait for it to happen.   


I've always been someone that appreciated their space, I like being alone, I work almost 80 hours a week (shop split with contract work), I have a dog, I have stuff I need to take care of essentially. I've always been greedy with money, in the sense I will work myself until I break just for a fat paycheck, I had taken 3 unscheduled days off in the last 2 and a half years, I worked 228 days straight last year to fill a position we didn't have any good candidates for ON TOP of my contract work. My ex used to tell me my bosses were taking advantage of me, despite my raises, bonuses and their offers of ""gifts"" (free stuff from the shop) and small vacations up to their house away from everything. New S.O? One of the reasons he fell for me is his appreciation of my work ethic. We both know that I don't HAVE to do the things I'm asked of (I technically hold 3 job titles in the company) but I do it because I want a stable future for me and my dog (and multiple others that will be added to the pack).

&amp;#x200B;

My ex yelled at me and started an argument over the amount of work I do for the company, he stormed out of my house in a huff, because I had mentioned I was stressed. I was, however, anyone who knows me (which we had been together for 4 years at that point, he should have known me by then) knows stress is my optimal condition, I just need to vent sometimes to even it out. New S.O? ""I love your work ethic, they don't pay you enough for what you do imo, but I love that you just want to help, pay or not, I want to learn your workflow so I can better myself, I love your brain and I want to learn from you and you can vent to me anytime, I just want to be as helpful as you are"" Guys, I melted. The drastic difference, if I hadn't already fallen for him that sentence alone, HNNNG. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what else to say beside, we went on our first ""real"" date tonight, I fell asleep off and on during the movie, and instead of getting mad and yelling at me for it like it would have been in the past, he offered to go and see the movie with me again, not wait for it to come out on DVD but just go and do another dinner/movie date night.   


It's a weird transition for me, and I don't want to have to keep telling him that because he knows my ex and I don't want to keep bringing him up (not that I ever did intentionally, there was just work issues and social media BS that we had to deal with) but it is. I screwed up the other night and he reacted so kindly and so unexpectedly nice that I had to ask/tell him to yell at me for it because that's what I am used to and his kindness was making me uncomfortable and uneasy. He refused, but has vowed to undo the damage that has been done from my past, and whether or not he is successful... I just really love having him in my life, in any capacity.   


Bottom line, at the end of the day, I love this man so much. I usually take time off after relationships to figure myself out, recover, all that usual stuff. This time was different, my last relationship devolved in such a way I basically did all of that while still with my ex, I learned how to stand up for myself because my ex treated me so badly that he was the first person I HAD to stand up to (In order to break it off). I know who I am now, I know my worth, I know that all of the insecurities I had devolved because of my ex are BS, and most of all, I have someone in my life to reaffirm, support and guide me in life. All of the things that used to be arguments in past relationships, he just does, without having to ask (we never discussed these things either, he just does the things), things I do just for the sake of it, he loves and thinks it's the best thing in the world. I was worried at first all of it was because he hadn't been with anyone for so long, but it turns out, these are all things he never got to do in past relationships and we just click so well all of our quirks and weird habits line up.  


My favorite moment that I will end this rant/vent/gush with, is this. We were in my bed the other night, ordered a pizza. He said he wanted to ""keep the slob side of myself away from you for as long as possible"" earlier that night. Pizza arrived, we brought it to my room and he asked ""So are we getting plates"" I looked at him and said, ""that box is our plate."" I have never seen someone light up over something so mundane, but he followed it with ""I was trying to keep my slob side away from you as to not scare you off, but we are on THE EXACT same level"". 

&amp;#x200B;

We are on the same page about everything, he is the male version of me, and I am the female version of him. And we could not be happier.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help it, and it was completely unexpected, but I love my new S.O so much.

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, at the end of the day, I love this man so much. I usually take time off after relationships to figure myself out, recover, all that usual stuff. This time was different, my last relationship devolved in such a way I basically did all of that while still with my ex, I learned how to stand up for myself because my ex treated me so badly that he was the first person I HAD to stand up to (In order to break it off). I know who I am now, I know my worth, I know that all of the insecurities I had devolved because of my ex are BS, and most of all, I have someone in my life to reaffirm, support and guide me in life. All of the things that used to be arguments in past relationships, he just does, without having to ask (we never discussed these things either, he just does the things), things I do just for the sake of it, he loves and thinks it&amp;#39;s the best thing in the world. I was worried at first all of it was because he hadn&amp;#39;t been with anyone for so long, but it turns out, these are all things he never got to do in past relationships and we just click so well all of our quirks and weird habits line up.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite moment that I will end this rant/vent/gush with, is this. We were in my bed the other night, ordered a pizza. He said he wanted to &amp;quot;keep the slob side of myself away from you for as long as possible&amp;quot; earlier that night. Pizza arrived, we brought it to my room and he asked &amp;quot;So are we getting plates&amp;quot; I looked at him and said, &amp;quot;that box is our plate.&amp;quot; I have never seen someone light up over something so mundane, but he followed it with &amp;quot;I was trying to keep my slob side away from you as to not scare you off, but we are on THE EXACT same level&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are on the same page about everything, he is the male version of me, and I am the female version of him. And we could not be happier.&lt;/p&gt;

She's my girl. She feels like home. Even before we got together, she was always the one for me. Should've noticed sooner, I guess.

i accepted that are date will never happen, next day she start acting weird, she was ice cold with me, and it continued, so i couldn't hold it. i told her i was going to her college so we could go home together, i told her that late night and her answer was: no, im going out to have coffee with mi ex. i was devastated, i couldn't sleep that night, i couldn't eat the next day, i told her we were going out.

me: we need to talk, do you eat lunch together this friday?

gf:  no

me: why are you busy?

gf: no, i dont want to see you.

me: (really mad) ok, ill se you friday 1 pm, in blank, not taking a no for an answer.

the day came and she wrote me a letter because it's hard for her to say things, so i read it it was full of little details some things she didn't like but nothing like game breaking

me: ok, give me your phone.

gf: what???

me: you heard me,

i start scrolling messages, found her ex chat, im going to summarize, it said:

ass: you look good

gf: thanks i have i new jean skirt, that makes me look sexy

ass: send me some pics

gf: maybe later im tired and its dark

ass: remember all the ""Fun"" (me changing things)

gf: yes i do, ""sexy faces""

ass: well to bad you have a boyfriend now, do you love him?

gf: no, i like him, but i don't love him (a week ago she leaved me note saying ps: i love you)

ass: will you come back with me ?

gf: noy now, maybe i don't know

if the place was quitter you could totally heard my heart crush into pieces, but i really love her, i understood she was really confuse, she got scare when things went serious (we have been together 4 time more than with her ex), we where making plans for the future and i was not ready to let her go, i told her she had to give up her past if she wanted a future, i told her that she loves me (she was really sweet and caring before) that the only fooling its herself, that she was to scared of having a heart broken that she run to her comfort zone. she cried and told her ex that she finally found happiness.

i wish the story end up there, but no she was weird one day and i ask her, it was the same that before (actually we have this fight every time it gets serious), and ask the full story, she told me with such detail like the weather, the clothes, for 2 hours i listened how great he was, (was not she told me he was an ass a few months ago), and i was ok why when he asked for me, i was so unimportant? i just fell bad and alone.

i told her i love her and love is all i can give her, if that's not im out, she cried all night and tried to comfort her, and then she was fine. things went back to normal, kind of

we went out and she was more loving and more happy but she cannot fool me i stop her and asked how she felt, she said she was still a little hurt and was scare of having another broken heart that she loved me so much ... and if she opened more and i hurt her she will not be able no handle it, and that is why she wanted to leave.

we are still together and the last time she was has the cute smiling girl i fall in love with. but i have depression and my birthday is next week, its kind of important for me,  im sure she doesnt know, what should i do? tell her its my birthday coming i don't want a give i just need your support right now... let the date pass by  so one the she says whens your birthday and ill say it was a month ago, no big deal (for me it is), i honestly don't know.

Every single thing about him. 

His flaws, his perfections, not a single thing changes how I feel about him. 

Not every single day is a perfect page from a storybook, but there isn’t a single moment that I am not completely and absolutely in love with him. 

I cherish every kiss, every hug, every time we hold hands, every smile we share, every inside joke, every moment with him, for even the messy, sometimes hard times teach me lessons on how to become a better girlfriend &amp; better partner to him.

In the time we’ve been together, I’ve seen myself grow as a person &amp; discover new things about myself &amp; realized what it feels like to love someone and to be loved. Previously, I have never experienced such joy, such absolute care. It’s amazing.

My heart feels like it’s soaring, just thinking about him makes me bubbly &amp; fulfilled. I keep a picture of him on my bedside table, which is something I’ve NEVER done before. It’s pure, it makes me feel safe and serves as a reminder of how I’m loved &amp; who I’m loved by. 

This man... he makes me feel things I’ve never felt before. He’s so gentle, so caring, so kind. He’s extremely mature but also manages to be a complete goofball in all the best ways. He’s understanding. He makes me feel safe, protected. There’s nothing I wouldn’t do to make him feel just as safe &amp; secure with me as I do with him.

One moment in particular: we were spending time together at his house, and he was getting tired. He wasn’t in the mood to kiss and all that, which is completely fine. I just cuddled up to him &amp; moved so he could lay on my chest and I could hold him in my arms to keep him warm and make him feel, and the smile on his face was so sweet and pure. I’d do anything to make him feel like that everyday. I love him, so very much.

I’ve never in my life been so sure that I’m in love, and I’m so grateful to be with someone as breathtakingly astounding as my boyfriend.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Him.&lt;/p&gt;

- 1️⃣ *‘cupiditas’*
- 2️⃣ *’amor’*
- 3️⃣ *’amicitia’*
- 4️⃣ *’dilectatio’*

These four words are the root, basis, and template for the various forms of love we experience in our lives.

The most primitive type of love is __*’cupiditas’*__, or carnal desire / lust. In this type of love, the focus lies within oneself. The individual DESIRES the other. It’s the shallowest form of love. It’s simply a simple crush. 

&gt;You: “I don’t really know you, but I want you.”

The next form of love is __*’amor’*__, or affection / sexual passion. Although this form of love is deeper than *‘cupiditas’*, the focus still lies within the individual.

&gt;You: “I love the way you make ME feel”. 

&gt;Them: “I love the way you make ME feel, too!”

Sadly, despite defensive claims otherwise, most relationships don’t make it past this stage. Because the focus is on the individual, the love is still not deeply rooted. Once the beloved no longer makes the lover feel “that way”, the relationship is shaken, often irreparably. Would you still love them if they cheated on you? Would you still love them if they betrayed you, or hurt you?

Next there is __*‘amicitia’*__, or friendship, indicating an alliance / bond. 

&gt;”The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.” 

*’Amicitia’* is a love beyond simple sexual passion. It’s founded in the appreciation and admiration of the other person’s character and mind - his or her very being. The significance of *‘amicitia’* is in the shift away from the self. This type of love is what you feel with your closest friends. With friendship, love is more foundational and solid. It’s something beyond mere physical attraction. There’s a reason friendships tend to last longer than romantic relationships.

The highest form of love is __*‘dilectatio’*__, or delight. *’Dilectatio’* is a complete shift away from yourself. It is a rational love. It is a considerate love. It is a sacrificial love. It is loving someone so much that you would give your life for them, take a bullet for them - no matter the risk, no matter their capacity to completely and utterly devastate you. It is the realization that one day, they WILL destroy you.

The BEST possible scenario in love is that you give your everything to someone, and them you; you commit and devote your life to them, in sickness and in health, and them you; they drive you to conquer your most challenging obstacles, motivate you to reach and surpass your greatest heights, share in your victories, your triumphs, your glory - and you them; they become your rock during the darkest trials and tribulations in life - heartbreak, loss, failure - and you them; they show you beauty in times of sorrow, making you believe again that life is worth living, tearing down your steely walls of pessimism and cynicism. 

And then... Then, they die.

Despite the crushing pain love can and will bring you, despite the pain they will cause you - you love them with unconditional acceptance anyway. You bare every inch of the depths of your soul anyway, fully recognizing and understanding what you risk.

For me, I don’t think I’ve ever TRULY made it past *‘amor’* in any of my past relationships. I have realized that I have strong decade+ long friendships (*‘amicitia’*) with a deeper, more resilient love than any of the girls I’ve dated in the past (bros before hoes, lol). I’ve never felt *’dilectatio’*, but I still naively hope it’s possible. Most days I have my doubts. Despite my trust issues and emotional baggage (got cheated on, abandoned, rejected), I want to be capable of delighting. I want to be a man worthy of another’s delight. It’s a long journey to *’dilectatio’*, but I’m driven to reach the destination.

You have that friend to talk to at 3am, with a cup of coffee in your hand; then you have another to talk to at 3pm with a pot full of chowmein.

You have one friend who goes to every Marvel movie with you; then you have that one who completely understands why you don't watch Breaking Bad.

You have one to praise you; another to spit truth on your face.

You have friends and each one of them serve some purpose in your life. 

You too, hopefully, serve some purpose in their lives.

So, stop for a second there; stop searching for love everywhere. Look out through those painted windows of 'love' or 'partner' or every word dedicated to 'The One'.

You'll find your The One; or maybe you won't. 

But find Yourself and find your Them. Maybe surviving won't be so hard after that. 

\#dedicated to all those who make breathing easier for someone else :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many say that &amp;#39;love&amp;#39; is this and &amp;#39;love&amp;#39; is that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But leave love alone for a second - have you ever thought about friendship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who put &amp;#39;friendship&amp;#39; in a box are the ones on the losing side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have that friend to talk to at 3am, with a cup of coffee in your hand; then you have another to talk to at 3pm with a pot full of chowmein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have one friend who goes to every Marvel movie with you; then you have that one who completely understands why you don&amp;#39;t watch Breaking Bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have one friend to follow you on Insta; another to protest about how social media is a ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have one to praise you; another to spit truth on your face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have friends and each one of them serve some purpose in your life. &lt;/p&gt;

Even though all people may tell you that you shouldn’t love them, that’s you can’t, they did you wrong, that can’t just change how you feel. It’s unreasonable to fall out of love like that if you truly loved them in the first place. I have never been good at showing my love, I’m self centered, my mind wanders, but at the end of the day despite all my big talk I only wanted to come back to her, subconsciously there was no woman in this whole world I cared about more than her. Even now when I know she doesn’t love me, she is with a new man, I struggle. I struggle badly I grapple with the pain and hatred but again with the yearning to have this amazing woman back in my life. Her smile, her hair, her laugh, her hips, her waist, her legs , I adored it all, but at the same time took it for granted, it’s the truth you don’t know you love her until you let her go. Especially true in my case, the night she asked to talk I told myself that it would
Be ok I would move on, but the second I looked into her face the second I saw her baggy shirt messy hair and Pajama pants I couldn’t hold it together I bawled like a little kid, a rush of emotion like nothing I had ever felt before came crashing through all of the barriers I had been putting up for years, it was like my whole world crumbled right before my eyes, I had no idea what to do, I understand now, I didn’t know what love meant until that day, I thought I loved but I didn’t truly understand the way that I personally love, and it’s the worst feeling in the world, after neglecting her all I want is to talk to her around the clock, after sparsely cuddling I want to hold her for hours and never let go. I want to sleep with her, watch her face as she drifts to sleep, I want to sleep with her and watch her beautiful face fill with pleasure and lust, but I feel I will never get the opportunity again, I wasn’t a good lover, I didn’t pay attention, I was the stereotypical bad boyfriend and she had put up with it for too long, long done with all of my none sense, quickly moving on to the next best thing. This eating away at my heart honestly and truly making me feel as if there is no reason to live life again, all I want is to have her smile in my arms, maybe this is why they say first love is so hard because it is, it makes you absolutely crazy. Despite her denying my feelings, despite her sleeping with someone else, despite her calling my love boring and making her uncomfortable , I will continue to love as crazy as it sounds. I will love in silence, hoping, praying that one day she will see how much I care, praying that one day she will understand that I love her through and through, the snarky comments everything I love her, I want to sing in her car again at the top of my lungs, I want to get drunk with her, high with her experience this big beautiful world with her, but I feel that my chances are slipping away like sand through my finger, so I need to cup my hands and hold onto whatever I can, hope and pray I can see her beautiful eyes again and see her look back into mine with love, although opposites I want to add to each other, finally do what I should have done. But nonetheless this is why I am writing it here. I don’t deserve another chance, I treated her awful but I’m selfish and annoying to I cling to the tiny hope I have in my mind that one day she will be my one and only girl again. And in all honesty, the physical attraction I felt for her was out of this world, although stereotypically she may not have been the best looking girl in the world, to me there was nobody more beautiful nobody more attractive in any way shape or form. But again I have attempted to tell her this with no luck therefore I will write it here, you are the love of my life, and I will pray and wait for the day you come back, everyone in my life can tell me to give up as they please. But I can’t, I wished to spend my life with you. To you to most beautiful girl in the world I give my whole self, everything I am to you, i will pray and wait. Love is crazy.. makes you stupid, the general idea of love makes no sense if you think about it, to make yourself vulnerable to another person in order to create a bond, but if there is one thing people alway do, it’s fall in love, so maybe people are crazy, maybe we all have a little bit of crazy in us. I know I hurt you, and you hurt me, but I can’t let go, there is something about it all I want to fix myself for you, I don’t want to grow alone I want to grow as a person with you, as I said before I want my whole life to be shared with you, so we can fill in the areas where the other is lacking. Maybe I’m not good looking enough, maybe my personality is awful but there are things I can fix, but you never let me. I’m sorry I wasn’t passionate enough I’m sorry I lied, there are so many things I’m sorry about, but if we get back together which I’m praying every day that we do we can figure it Out so we can both be happy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love&lt;/p&gt;

I struggle badly I grapple with the pain and hatred but again with the yearning to have this amazing woman back in my life. Her smile, her hair, her laugh, her hips, her waist, her legs , I adored it all, but at the same time took it for granted, it’s the truth you don’t know you love her until you let her go. Especially true in my case, the night she asked to talk I told myself that it would
Be ok I would move on, but the second I looked into her face the second I saw her baggy shirt messy hair and Pajama pants I couldn’t hold it together I bawled like a little kid, a rush of emotion like nothing I had ever felt before came crashing through all of the barriers I had been putting up for years, it was like my whole world crumbled right before my eyes, I had no idea what to do, I understand now, I didn’t know what love meant until that day, I thought I loved but I didn’t truly understand the way that I personally love, and it’s the worst feeling in the world, after neglecting her all I want is to talk to her around the clock, after sparsely cuddling I want to hold her for hours and never let go. I want to sleep with her, watch her face as she drifts to sleep, I want to sleep with her and watch her beautiful face fill with pleasure and lust, but I feel I will never get the opportunity again, I wasn’t a good lover, I didn’t pay attention, I was the stereotypical bad boyfriend and she had put up with it for too long, long done with all of my none sense, quickly moving on to the next best thing. This eating away at my heart honestly and truly making me feel as if there is no reason to live life again, all I want is to have her smile in my arms, maybe this is why they say first love is so hard because it is, it makes you absolutely crazy. Despite her denying my feelings, despite her sleeping with someone else, despite her calling my love boring and making her uncomfortable , I will continue to love as crazy as it sounds. I will love in silence, hoping, praying that one day she will see how much I care, praying that one day she will understand that I love her through and through, the snarky comments everything I love her, I want to sing in her car again at the top of my lungs, I want to get drunk with her, high with her experience this big beautiful world with her, but I feel that my chances are slipping away like sand through my finger, so I need to cup my hands and hold onto whatever I can, hope and pray I can see her beautiful eyes again and see her look back into mine with love, although opposites I want to add to each other, finally do what I should have done. But nonetheless this is why I am writing it here. I don’t deserve another chance, I treated her awful but I’m selfish and annoying to I cling to the tiny hope I have in my mind that one day she will be my one and only girl again. And in all honesty, the physical attraction I felt for her was out of this world, although stereotypically she may not have been the best looking girl in the world, to me there was nobody more beautiful nobody more attractive in any way shape or form. But again I have attempted to tell her this with no luck therefore I will write it here, you are the love of my life, and I will pray and wait for the day you come back, everyone in my life can tell me to give up as they please. But I can’t, I wished to spend my life with you. To you to most beautiful girl in the world I give my whole self, everything I am to you, i will pray and wait. Love is crazy.. makes you stupid, the general idea of love makes no sense if you think about it, to make yourself vulnerable to another person in order to create a bond, but if there is one thing people alway do, it’s fall in love, so maybe people are crazy, maybe we all have a little bit of crazy in us. I know I hurt you, and you hurt me, but I can’t let go, there is something about it all I want to fix myself for you, I don’t want to grow alone I want to grow as a person with you, as I said before I want my whole life to be shared with you, so we can fill in the areas where the other is lacking. Maybe I’m not good looking enough, maybe my personality is awful but there are things I can fix, but you never let me. I’m sorry I wasn’t passionate enough I’m sorry I lied, there are so many things I’m sorry about, but if we get back together which I’m praying every day that we do we can figure it Out so we can both be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

Now I'm dating, and I sometimes notice myself being sad when I see someone a few times and it doesn't really click. That used to drive me nuts and really make me feel kind of hopeless, like I'm unable to love. Now, my mindset is changing to a more positive view.*

Rather than think you meet someone and it clicks or it doesn't, I realise the last big love I had wasn't just a matter of whether it clicked or not. There were difficult times in those 10 years, times when I didn't feel profoundly in love, and other times when I did. And I think **we can influence that a lot**. When you keep seeing someone, thinking of them, making plans with them, caring for them and being nice, you act like they're very important to you, and over time they become just that.

And the inverse is also true: when you break up with someone, you're not condemned to eternally being alone and yearning for your former partner. You start focusing on other things in life, and other people, and as you do so, you slowly fall out of love. It's not pretty, but it works.

So in the end, we don't need to be scared of 'not clicking' with somebody. If we keep searching, we'll find several people in a lifetime that are compatible enough to stick around for a while, and it's the decision to stick around that enables you to build love, it's not something that is just gifted from the heavens. You build it yourself.

**TLDR: Love is something you can consciously choose to pursue and build, and not something you're given based on random chance. A crush might happen to you, but actual love doesn't 'happen' - you make it yourself with whomever you choose. It's not about finding 'the one'.**

*NB: Biologically, this also makes sense. In ages past, when people met much fewer strangers in their lives than we do now with modern travelling and big cities, they still did find love. It's such a central topic in much of literature, including ancient texts... It's hard to believe we would have evolved in a way that only makes love possible if we meet 'the one' in a city-size dating pool of several million people that we can filter with Tinder.*","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some context: So, I&amp;#39;ve recently had a break-up with someone very dear to me who was more or less at the centre of my life for 10 years (I&amp;#39;m 28).

&lt;p&gt;I know nothing in life is owed to anyone but I just hope I can find someone to really fall in love and be with.&lt;/p&gt;

Today with social media, everyone has to have a ""story"". So with that being said, we see that same guy today going for that girl of his dreams, not knowing that girl is going to try to find a way to validate her feelings based off of your actions or vise versa. Whether or not its really your fault, what ever it may be, and no matter hard you may want to think they wouldn't do that it doesnt matter to them because they want the story. They want to find that amazing guy, who treats them right so they can make it into either a fairytale or the ""just like eveyone else"" sob story. Everyone wants that fairytale relationship but forget about the insecure, immature, and stupid things that are going to come with a relationship of the 20th century. 
Women today want that assertive almost ""thug"" type of person, some big, strong, unemotional guy who will beat the shit out of anyone who looks at them in a way they dont like. That's primal, its instinct, its nature, they want to feel protected emotionally and physically. Up until the man shows emotion and gets labeled as a ""bitch"", ""pussy"", or ""emotionally unstable"". What you cant have is both ways, thats another problem with today's love. People expect certain treatment but dont give it back. People expect a type of love and dont show that love back. People will put in little effort and expect others to go out of their way. 
You have someone who genuinely cares,  but today if someone isnt benefiting from it than they stop caring. The end of the word unconditionally. You could have the most down to earth person in your corner and they could still be subconsciously manipulating you to do what they want or act the way they want and not even know it. You can have someone who supports your every emotion up until it has to do with them and their actions and how those actions made you feel. Then the second they you put them in a negative light it turns into them being offended with the way you feel and that's where most toxic relationships start. Lack of communication, and since everyone on this planet has been raised to think that emotions are bad than they reflect that energy back. Some people want you to sit there, feel bad for them and think they're alone but they have every reason to be happy. 9 times out of 10 those people who really feel worthless and alone care about other people more than anyone else. They litterally put others thoughts, opinions, and emotions before their own.
The problem with today's love is everyone wants that person they can sit down and grow old with, put a ring on their finger and lock down but the reality is most people dont even deserve the people they have, and most people today are never satisfied with where their ""story"" might end. I think people are either afraid to talk about how they really feel or they're immature and they've gotten by this far off the sympathy of others and it makes them feel good to constantly have something to feel miserable about because it just brings more miserable people into their life. Thats what they want subconsciously. They want the easy way out. They want to put a ring on that girls finger in hopes that it will bring back the person she was when he first met her, not knowing that shes gone and will never come back because she never existed in the first place. It was just a game to that person so they could make you feel like you were important, like you had a purpose in their life. All up until they feel like they dont need you anymore. Then most of the good people are left feeling like they did something wrong, and it turns them bitter and cold to the word love.

I've been working on a friendship with a wonderful, gorgeous woman for nearly 8 years now. She was a friend of a girl I was with during college, and we struck up our own friendship which consisted mainly of texting and the occasional phone call for years. We connected very easily over the similar struggles we had dealt with when we were younger. It was a tight bond and it served us both well to have a long distance friend just there to listen at the end of the day.


This person helped me through breakups, and consoled me through some of the toughest days of my life. I'm a pretty sentimental guy, so it was easy for me to play the same role for her. She talked me out of times when I didn't think I would ever be worth anything. There were periods where it felt like her struggles were mine, and like my struggles were hers.

I learned a couple years into the whole thing that she had some pretty strong feelings for me. I was a bit of a mess in terms of relationships in my early 20s. But the truth was that deep down I was terrified that if we had tried, and something were to go wrong, I might lose that friendship and her altogether. I would never forgive myself for that.

To be honest, she should have left me in the dust several times. Not because of any mistreatment or terrible things I said/did to her, but because of how taken for granted her feelings towards me were. I always held her in high regard, but never viewed her romantically.

Then, a while back, she moves to a town roughly 30 minutes from my house, in Maine. Very close by our standards (normally our rare visits had been a 2ish hour trip one way). It had been a couple of years with no visits and sharply diminished contact, (I was a mess for unrelated reasons), so I asked her if we could find time to hang out. She said yes.

I was honestly just excited to see my friend again, to not be talking through a screen, all that. But then when I saw her, saw how she was doing, and how her life had grown, I felt something that I hadn't felt in a long time. She had grown up so much. The old comfort we always had was still there. It was peaceful. We wandered around and chatted for hours.

Much to her surprise, I asked what she was doing that weekend. And we made plans again. And again. And eventually, once I realised what was going on, I didn't take long to tell her. I think she had kind of sniffed it out before I told her, just where we've come to know each other so well.

Fast forward to a night in early April, around 1 in the morning really, and I couldn't really keep it down anymore. I told her I wanted it to be us, and I know she's going to get the best version of me that I've ever offered to anyone. We get to skip the awkward ""getting to know the basics about each other"" phase and just pursue the goals we want together. If I can reward her patience even slightly for putting up with my thick skull for years, it's worth it.


Thing is, life doesn't give you choice over who you get to keep around and who goes. Friendships, relationships, and family; things you think are constants are always subject to change. We both know this might end some day, but we're here to make it work for as long as we can. I already have love for this person based on our history, even if I wouldn't define us as ""in love"" just yet. And I couldn't be more grateful for her existence, now more than ever.

If anyone has any stories like this or anything at all related, I would love to hear it. If you read my story, thank you. These are unique times.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Front-end tl;dr: Sometimes the whole &amp;quot;they were right in front of you the whole time&amp;quot; cliché is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thing is, life doesn&amp;#39;t give you choice over who you get to keep around and who goes. Friendships, relationships, and family; things you think are constants are always subject to change. We both know this might end some day, but we&amp;#39;re here to make it work for as long as we can. I already have love for this person based on our history, even if I wouldn&amp;#39;t define us as &amp;quot;in love&amp;quot; just yet. And I couldn&amp;#39;t be more grateful for her existence, now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any stories like this or anything at all related, I would love to hear it. If you read my story, thank you. These are unique times.&lt;/p&gt;

Anwa’s face lit up in the most beautiful smile he had ever seen. Nath smiled back. She smiled more and so did he. Then they broke out laughing. It was silly, but oh my, it felt good, Nath thought. He felt really comfortable with this woman. It was almost strange, because he could sit and watch the sunset in silence with her, be silly with her and call her beautiful, without even once being a bit nervous.

“Thank you. I don’t really think I am beautiful. I think I am wilder woman, than some men like.” Anwa replied.

“Oh no, you have that wrong, men like wild!” Nath laughed. “All guys like a bit of wild woman.”

Anwa burst into laughter again, she laughed so hard that tears began to well in her eyes. Nath grabbed her waist and tried soothing her, although he was laughing hard too. Anwa’s hand fluttered down onto his lap as he held onto her waist. They both took deep breaths, trying to calm down the laughter bubbling up inside of them. Then they burst into laughter again. They forgot what they were even laughing about! *It was so silly! But she loved the way this man made her feel, Anwa thought. It was like she had nothing to hide from him. It was truly a wonderful feeling.* 

Nath’s hand moved up and down her back trying to soothe the laughing fit out of her. Finally, she calmed down and started breathing heavy but normal. Nath sensed something, he was not sure what, but it felt like he should kiss her. She looked up and their eyes locked. Her hand stayed firmly on his leg. The heat was building between their bodies at an amazing rate. Nath felt his head swim. His penis hardened instantly. Hopefully, she doesn’t notice, he thought. Right at that moment, as if on cue, she looked down. Yes, she just noticed, Nath thought. He pulled her body a tiny bit closer. He needed to kiss this woman, something was pulling him to her with an incredible energy that he couldn’t describe. He lifted his other hand to her chin. She was breathing heavily. 

“Anwa! Where are you?” Garth’s voice boomed over the beach.

She jumped up, as if stung by a scorpion. “Oh my, that is Garth! I must go help get the boat ready!” She bolted and ran away across the sand towards the dock. She turned back once and waved at Nath. “It was so nice meeting you, Nath!”

Nath stood, dumbfounded, watching her run away, feeling like someone had just took away his favourite toy. He waved back to the disappearing Anwa, Miss Wild Woman, her beautiful long hair flowing behind her. “Yes! It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Anwa!” His hand floated in the air, wishing he could pull her back here to where they were and finish what had happened. *What had happened? he thought. He was going to kiss her, that’s what!*

He stood rooted to the sand for several moments, willing his erection to go away. It persisted valiantly, so he slumped down and sat in the sand. He watched the sun while his erection softened. *Wow, he thought, he really likes this woman!* This was the first time he had experienced such a thing, was it called, chemistry? Or just raw attraction. He didn’t know, but whatever it was, it felt amazing, he felt like he was floating! He smiled, bent his knees, wiped the sand from his pants and began to walk back to the house. His heart lifted and he felt like his steps were somehow lighter. In no time, he reached Jonasson’s house. He had been running! He didn’t even realize it! He felt so happy.

It makes me wonder if things would be different if I was a bit taller. I’m sorry, I’ve deviated from my original question. Is it wrong that I want to hug my girlfriend ?&lt;/p&gt;

my enemy.. who turned into my bestfriend.. turned into my lover.. sounds SO cliche right? It might sound cringey but, it really did happen to me

So back in eigth grade, I really hated this guy named Lucas (not his real name), we were in the same volleyball team (except he was on the men's volleyball team duh), so we trained together alot. He would always bug me, annoy me, and would start crying over petty stuff. The feeling was mutual, because it was evident that he hated me too. So we basically shaded each other for like six months. Adding fuel to the fire, our teammates would ALWAYS tease us to each other. I felt so disgusted. 

Fast forward to sports week, I was having alot of problems back around that time, my grandmother was very ill, I was very ill (I was in and out of the hospital) and to top things off my guy bestfriend had left me. His reason? That I was a jealous freak. (This is another story LMFAO). So, I was lonely at that time. I went to the cafeteria to eat lunch, and saw Lucas eating all alone. I decided to sit at his table without saying a word. He just looked at me as if I commited a crime. He asked me what came into my mind that made me sit with him, he even teased me that maybe I had a secret crush on him. He offered me food. I was being quiet and rude the whole time. When I ended up crying, I opened up to him and he was so gentle and understanding. I spent the whole week with him. We got really close when he started tutoring me in math and history, he's really smart, and he's a strict tutor btw, that's where we got real close.

A year and a half passed by, we got closer than ever and we were in the same class already. I started having feelings for him, I confessed to him before christmas and to my luck--- he liked me months before I even started to have feelings for him. He told me that he was afraid that i'd friendzone him, and that he wouldn't reach my standards when infact he met all of them.


We're still young and not ready for a relationship, i'm so glad he isn't forcing me into a relationship. But he already introduced me to his parents as his ""future girlfriend"" which is really funny to me and cute. He's adorable. I'm lucky to have him. But I still don't know where me and Lucas will head to, but I hope it's a good path!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[STORYTIME LOL]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a couple of weeks since you ended our friendship and I’m mourning the memory of you while you’re still alive, probably just fine. I ain’t religious but I pray to God every day you’ll text me and ask if I’m okay so I can tell you I’m not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God I’m so in love with you, and I’m 7 years too late. I hope you do big things in life, I hope you make another girl laugh the way you made me laugh, and I’ll always miss your beautifully handsome soul. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love,
The girl who always said we were just friends&lt;/p&gt;

It’s just a way that I am I guess. Wondering around in the dark frustrates the living shit out of me.

So basically, back to the main, juicy (?) point. He’s 2 years younger than me (I’m almost 18) and a family friend. We don’t hang out that much but this time we are, I guess you could say, trapped together in a house for the holidays (a week in total) which means it’s impossible for us not to interact.

I’m a very outgoing, loud and joyful person. I like to talk a lot and will never leave someone just sitting alone in the corner, especially if they are our guests. It’s also important to point out that my sense of humor is very dirty, open and overall without a shame. Me and my friends “flirt” with each other non stop, so that’s nothing new to me but when it comes to other people that I don’t know so well, I’m lost.

This is getting pretty long so let me give you some examples:

-me, him and my best friend were sitting around a fireplace and previous to that he had already made some comments about my arm being hot, due to hot fire (I was resting my head on his legs, facing my best friend, not seeing his facial expression) but this time he said “you are so hot” and instantly I responded (in a jokey way) with “Oh i know, I’m always hot”. He blushed and shook his head, while smiling ofc.

-while lying next to the fireplace he kept “punching” me with plushies and touching my arms. Whenever I told he to stop, cause he was distracting me from reading, he just smiled and continued. He kept doing this till we had to move elsewhere.

-Let me add that he has a “girl” that he’s talking to constantly (that meaning him being on his phone most of the time replying to her, whenever I’ve asked him about her he simply put his phone away, by which I’m not really bothered because after all we aren’t that close) and today he also said (it was in a context of a conversation we were having) that to him it doesn’t 
feel right to flirt with more than one girl at a time...

-We were swimming in a pool and for 2 or more days he didn’t dare to splash me or do anything with me in that joke-ish childish manner but today I guess he got super brave or something and pushed me into water multiple times. He also allowed me to be all over him while trying to “drown” him (that sounds really bad, but English isn’t my 1st language so i don’t t know better)

-whenever I look at him he smiles back

-our parents keep making weird comments and giving us weird looks. That is, let me say, nothing unusual for our parents (they are very open minded and love to joke around). But still it gets me wondering if they know something I don’t.

-he also had multiple “guy conversations” with my step dad (which I am very close to) about god knows what (probably girls) but personally I believe they were talking about me. I know that’s reaching but oh well...

I guess that were my main points. The last thing I would like to add is that yes I am I guess “flirting” with him back but that’s a part of my humor and I’m like that with everyone...I am aware that he maybe doesn’t know that and that is the reason why he is “playing along” you could say but I really don’t know.

It is so disheartening and i'm slowly coming to grips with the fact that she may never feel the same about me as i do for her.

Hello! I'm a Master's student at Queen's University (Ontario, Canada). I'm doing my Master's research on a distressing and poorly understood condition called 'persistent genital arousal disorder' (or PGAD for short), and I'm seeking to better understand how this disorder affects relationship dynamic when one member is affected. As a part of my study, I am also looking to recruit a group of healthy individuals who are involved in a romantic relationship to complete a quick survey on sexual, relationship, and overall well-being. The survey itself is very quick, and will only take approximately 15 minutes to complete. The survey is open to **all** individuals who are ~~18~~ **60** years of age or older, and currently in a romantic relationship for a minimum of three months.

It’s knowing you despite your mystery because we’re so alike it’s scary... but so different at times I laugh.
You made a cynic fall, I fell hard.
I’m not one to stick around but the moment I found you at my side I never left.
I need to find a new story for myself, one that doesn’t hurt so much. 
Thank you for beating me at my own game.&lt;/p&gt;

I love you and all of your quirks. I love how you can tell me anything about piano keys and coins. I love when you play the office theme song with your eyes closed and part your lips just a tad in concentration. I love that you love the Beatles and try so hard to learn songs on the piano that I like. You say your memory is bad but you still remember the little things like a song I once listened to or how I’m allergic to earrings. 

I never want this relationship to end. God damn you stole my heart and my breathe and it’s crazy. You are my best friend and my soulmate. 

I mean we are in a relationship over pizza rolls and because I took 3 hours to ask you out.

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have anxiety with you I have anxiety without you. When I’m next to you and when I think about you everything is bliss. Here and there I worry about messing up but it’s all so I don’t lose you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are my everything. You are my Pam. You won’t read this before prom on Friday. But it’s going to be the best night ever. You are going to look adorable in your tux. When you don’t know what you’re doing and hold my waist like a lego figure it will just remind me how I am so in love with you that nothing you do is wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you and all of your quirks. I love how you can tell me anything about piano keys and coins. I love when you play the office theme song with your eyes closed and part your lips just a tad in concentration. I love that you love the Beatles and try so hard to learn songs on the piano that I like. You say your memory is bad but you still remember the little things like a song I once listened to or how I’m allergic to earrings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never want this relationship to end. God damn you stole my heart and my breathe and it’s crazy. You are my best friend and my soulmate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean we are in a relationship over pizza rolls and because I took 3 hours to ask you out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that and it has only been 5 months; it feels like I’ve known you forever. We’ve never kissed nor will we ever need to. I will wait for you for everything forever because you are my one and only. Mi amor &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

[Background]

Alright so there’s this girl in my university that studies the same major and we have same labs and everything but I just noticed her after 5 . She’s a great girl and I love everything about her. She’s an amazing painter(this will come in handy later on) and I just fell in love with her mindset and just everything about her. The signs of having a crush were there (losing the attraction to do anything sexual, being motivated for no reason, and always looking for her just to see her). I approached her with a great gesture and I was very confident when I spoke to her and I think that is what made everything flow smoother. We text but no more than 2 conversations a day. 

So here falls the main conflict:

She does sweet things that makes me feel like she’s into me and maybe you would call them signs but it’s only when I text first or talk. She’s a bit awkward with people but surprisingly she’s always comfortable with talking to me. Multiple signs show up like drawing a love scene from my favorite movie instead of focusing on her own paintings and when I asked her to take a pic and send it to me she refused and told me I’ll give it to you when I see you(told ya it would come in handy), tells me how bad her day was(she doesn’t do that with anyone else), asks about me a lot but only when I start the chatting, and other small things that make me feel so happy, BUT I always realize that I always start texting first which is weird. She likes talking to me but i don’t know why she never texts first and I think if I don’t text her for 4 days she won’t even notice it. What does that mean? Am I taking everything as a sign? Should I go on with this or is it gonna end up with a heartbreak? Or maybe I’m overreacting.

Most of the time but acting quite embarrassed or shy? During that party she gave me her phone number, she texted me al day I didn’t reply that often but she kept searching contact, after 2 weeks we set up a “date” we planned I was going to her place and use some drugs together we were still
Both sober at the time and before I knew we started kissing etc.. contact was still great 2 weeks later she asks me on a Sunday midday, what I was doing I told her I was just at home relaxing, she wanted to come to me from a pretty far place with her car towards me “to smoke some weed” she arrived we got some
Weed after we get out the store, she says “i missed you” and we gave each other a kiss and started walking hand to hand we went to get some drinks etc and that’s when we started to smoke the joint, I useally don’t smoke weed anymore for some reason my body can’t handle it any more but I was like fuck it I’ll do it, and yes it went badly I told her i was gonna force myself to vomit cause I started to get annoyed by the weed space, later on we got out the car and moved to a bench she held my hands and said “how do you see this between us?” Where I replied I don’t know we wil have to see each other some more before we can adjust such thing, she then says “but there should be feelings by now then right” I said something can’t remember what exactly but she stopped holding hands, later we got our own way gave each other a kiss, apologized about the weed experience she said it was ok and not to worry after that we became silent no contact nothing, how ever she stil sends Snapchat’s which we both reply, and I see her sometimes at parts but she just gets awkward and goes away like she doesn’t know what to say to me, what did I do wrong??

I thought that waiting over 4 years before getting into another relationship was enough time for me to heal and rejuvenate my trust for people - after my ex cheated on me constantly, his manipulation and the flat-out emotional abuse. 

When I met my current boyfriend, I felt like I was really ready. I was completely happy with my self and my independence. I wasn’t even looking for a relationship. But he swept me off my feet. I had complete and utter trust in him, his views on cheating aligned with mine, he treated me with respect and made me feel like the most beautiful girl in the world. 

Then his ex called. She didn’t say anything inherently bad, but it really shook me. He told me as soon as it happened, offered to show me the messages, never giving me a reason to doubt my trust for him. But it really affected me. For weeks I couldn’t stop thinking I was the rebound, that if she wanted to get back with him he’d leave me in a heartbeat - I could not stop comparing myself to her. My emotional healing had done a complete 180. 

But you know what he does? He holds me when I cry - my ex would tell me to leave. He reassures me when my PMS makes my insecurities overbearing - my ex would accuse me of being insane. He holds me tighter when my paranoia of him cheating should of pushed him away - my ex would break up with me, or actually cheat. But, he is not my ex. No matter how much my fear and doubt tries to mould him to be. 

He really is the most amazing guy. Even though I have little slip ups in my insecurities, I feel like we are back to square one, where I feel secure and safe with being vulnerable with him. I’ve never had such a mature, healthy relationship. We communicate, we support each other, we laugh together and above all, we trust each other. 

I love him more than words can describe, and I feel comfort in knowing he feels the same way.

We became friends and it got to the point where I was holding her hand and walking her home after school every day and we would hold each other on her beanbag in her room - whenever her mum or brother opened the door she would quickly sit across the room to pretend we were never being physically intimate.

While writing about this in another forum and I discovered something that I had never noticed before. You see, she would always talk about other, more popular and more extroverted guys and how she thought they were cool, it made me think that she had crushes on them and was in love with them while I was just some guy who had a crush on her, completely forgetting the fact that I was the one who she walked home with and spent time and physical intimacy with her.

It only occured to me as I was writing about this in another forum that she was probably just saying she liked these guys to make me jealous so I would be urged to kiss her.

When I was 13 and in my first year of high school I still had feelings for her initially and while that was the case I used to kiss her on the cheek goodbye, still feeling like I just couldn't let her know how intense my feelings were towards her.

I continued to get to know other girls and eventually those feelings subsided, even to the point where I completely forgot that they were there in the beginning at all!

Next year in high school those thoughts and feelings still weren't there anymore and I started seeing her in a more sexual way. Later on in the year I had the chance to touch my first pair of tits or should I say - my first three pairs.

I was staying at a friend's house with her, two other girls and two other guys and they basically let all three of us guys have a feel of them.

&lt;p&gt;Next year in high school those thoughts and feelings still weren&amp;#39;t there anymore and I started seeing her in a more sexual way. Later on in the year I had the chance to touch my first pair of tits or should I say - my first three pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was staying at a friend&amp;#39;s house with her, two other girls and two other guys and they basically let all three of us guys have a feel of them. Later in the year I got my first time to finger a girl too which was her as well, there were zero romantic thoughts or feelings - only sexual.&lt;/p&gt;

The first time you came to my house (which was also the first time we saw in person) it was the best day ever. I was so nervous that I was shaking, and I almost made you fall off. 

I have loved your laugh since the first time I heard it, and your smile, and your voice, and your hug, and your kisses, and you. Just you. I love you because you are you. 

You complete me, and understand me like no one ever did. Knowing that I can tell you literally anything is so amazing, and something I wouldn't think it would be possible for me in the past. But you made it possible by just being... you. 

You might think you don't show enough affection, and sometimes, it's true, but, you do. You show affection, and you give me love, even the times we are away. I know how much you like to be alone playing your games with no one bothering you, and still, you let me hear you scream while we are in a call. 

Sometimes I think I'm not ""perfect/good enough for you"", but no one is perfect. I might not have a big ass or big boobs, but I sure do have all the love to give you and a warm hug. 

I'm sorry I couldn't be there for your sister's birthday last year, I wish I was there. But this year, I promise I'll be there. And next year, and in the next year... I want to be there. 

I want to get married with you, which is something I never thought I would want. A nice small wedding with all our friends, and us saying our vows. And I also want to have kids, two kids, if you want too, of course. 

I just want to see the world with you. Travel everywhere, see everywhere, with you. Hold your hands in every place on earth. I just want to be there, with you.

And I really just want you to be mine, I thought when you broke up with her and maybe if I gave it time I could make something work but now you’re more distant than ever and its killing me, it kills me when you say you’re hooking up with some girl, it kills me when you’re not around because you’re with them, it kills me when I barely get enough of your time and it kills me even more when I realize i’m only distancing myself from you too, you are so fucking beautiful to me I love all your faults and I love everything good about you I love how we talk so fluently and how you know how to do everything right for me. 

I love how we share our interest and how we stare at each other’s eyes and how you always compare me to something stupid, like a muffin or a doggy. I love how everyone think’s your mean but to me you’re just a puppy, you’re so delicate and I love the little things about you that few know. 

I love the way your eye twitches and the way your voice softens towards me when we talk and how you play with my hands, I love when you put your hand on top of my head just to poke fun of my height, I know you like the control so I let you. I want to be more than just friends, I want to give you the care you deserve but you dont let me. You said whenever a girl confesses their feelings for you, you just force yourself to feel something so it doesn’t end up working. I dont want that, but theres not a lot I can do, i’m happy i’m your friend but it hurts when I think “Is this all i’ll ever be?”. 

You are always with somebody else and I think that hurts the most, I want you but for what we have now? Im will always be grateful for it. You are going to be a lesson in my life and I pray to god that you are going to be a good one.

Update 5/6/19:

You know that song My Kind Of Woman by Mac DeMarco? 

You made me understand the real feelings behind that song, even though its bluntly evident to figure out the meaning its not so much the same to truly feel what he sings about. You are my kind of man, I dont know what changed about you but you’ve stopped. You’ve stopped talking to these girls from my knowledge, I guess you’re over the sexual exploration phase but I fucking love it. 

You’ve only given me more time, we’ve called more and every night your voice is full of laughter every time. Every call you tell me you miss me at least 10 times, in every call you claim to want to hug me at least 6 times every. single. time, this time you want to kiss my head, and braid my hair. You dont know what this does to me, you dont know how much butterflies I get from hearing your voice saying all these things you want to do to me. They’re all so innocent and thats what makes me even redder every time you say them. 

Everything about us feels innocent. I never thought you’d come into my life, merely a year ago I had no idea you existed and now your existence is where my heart lies. 

I never saw you coming and its funny, we would’ve never became friends if I didn’t claim your abs were photoshopped.

I would never again take wishes and hypotheticals for reality. I promised myself I’d be rational. Logical. Calculated. I would be careful because I was at my breaking point. I was giving up on love entirely. 

I failed at this yet again. I let a girl convince me that she had feelings for me. She convinced me that she believed we were soulmates. That I was far superior to anyone she had ever felt affections for. Not that I was perfect but that I was her perfect fit. I truly believed that she believed I was her person. She was smart. She said all of the right things.  I genuinely felt like this one. This one would be different. I was duped. She did not believe any of this. I’m not even sure she liked me. On several occasions now she has willingly hurt my feelings, acknowledged that she hurt them, and proceeded to change nothing. I continued to let the same mistake be made over and over before i realized it wasn’t a mistake. She just did not feel the things she said she felt. I was not important. I was not cared for. Idk what I was. She is indifferent. My presence in her life is of no concern to her. It was all fake. It was all a lie.  

She was strange. She would be honest without being fully honest. She would lie but always though omission and it’s hard to call that a lie sometimes. She told me about her ex. I believed that she had told me everything there was to know. I was wrong. 

I liked her. A lot. More than i should’ve given the short time we knew each other. I had never been that excited about someone. Never. In my 21 years of life i have felt genuine love for another human on one other occasion. A girl i dated for 5 years. Which as a teenager felt like an eternity. And yet. Even after experiencing that. This was something new. This was an entirely new feeling. She was spectacular. Completely and entirely everything i had dreamt of. I truly believed that she would be my partner. I still do. I’m not sure why. I’m probably being naive and ignoring the very obvious truth in front of me. It’s just hard to see how someone could’ve faked it that well. Even if she didn’t care for me. How could she have learned all she did about my very rough past and not feel terrible about the decisions she’s made. It’s hard not to continue to chase it. Because I still feel like there must be something I’m missing. No way it should have been the way it was and ended the way it did. It doesn’t make sense. It honestly shouldn’t matter. It was intense and short lived. Nonetheless, I find myself wanting it more and more everyday. I want to send one more text. Just one more to see if it would get the response I’ve been waiting for. I stop myself. But i can’t distract myself very long. Whatever this witchcraft is I hope it passes before I lose my mind. 

I don’t know whether i will always cherish or always regret meeting her. It’s all such an anomaly for me. Never have i been like this. Never have i felt like this. Even when i feel like I’ve loved with all i could. Why did I do all I did? Why was I so kind? More than I’d ever been. Why was I so different? I was so happy and eager. So optimistic about everyday.

I had been dating someone at the time of talking to him again but instant thoughts came to my mind of remembrance of how happy he made me. To be completely honest...I’ve liked him since the 5th grade. But sometimes fear of losing the ones we love gets the best of us. Anyways. I feared that if in 5th I had asked him out it would never be the same friendship if we broke up, so I never asked. Recently, about a month and a half ago and even a little more, (we are both in 8th grade now) after finding him on Snapchat for the first time in around 3 years...I had been so happy. The person that I was dating I had always talked to my “crush” about because he understood me and would always be there to talk to me about him. And even, at the time i had no clue, the fact that he liked me while he was talking to me...he still talked to me about my bf at the time. As the relationship grew my relationship with my bf at the time was fading. He had never talked to me and had always been ignoring me. I would see the “Read” sign and he wouldn’t respond. I would see him not talk to me all day and then call me and then IMMEDIATELY hang up afterwards before I could answer...and I started to think all of the worst things like maybe I wasn’t being there enough or maybe I was too clingy. But. I’m not so sure. But at that time I felt the right thing to do was to break up with him. Now I had never broken up with anyone before so it was new for me...and when I broke up with my now ex, all he had to say was...”I agree” so we broke up and we haven’t talked since. Through that whole process I was texting my “crush” at the time and he had somehow made me seem so happy even though I had just left my current ex. Later on, time passed and he had told me how he felt and that he knew that I had just gotten through with my ex but he wanted to know if I would date him..I had to take a minute to think about this because of the following reasons. The person I dated (now my ex) had been my best friend before we dated...and look how we ended up. And in 5th grade before I moved and lost all contact with my “crush”, me and him were also best friends, and I didn’t want me and him to end up like me and my ex at the time. So...I thought and thought and finally I came to a realization...the boy of my dreams, my soulmate, my crush was right there asking me to be his...and I had already let the chance to find out what love for him was like once, and I didn’t ever wanna do that again...so of course, I said yes. I said yes because of the way that he makes me feel. Now, I am happily dating him and will be for a very long time. We hang out almost every weekend and we cuddle and hug...we fall asleep on ft together...we talk as much as we can on ft every single day and our longest ft is 20 hours, no joke. I love him and I want to spend as long as humanly possible with him by his side. He is my soulmate and losing him would be like losing something like my heart or my entire life. That’s what he is to me, my whole life. He is always there for me in so many ways that no one else has been there for me before. He’s so funny and so sweet and so cute even when he likes to deny it. I hope that me and him last...I know for sure I won’t be going anywhere anytime soon or ever. I know he will see this.

So there’s this girl, let’s call her S.

I knew her back in grade 1 until 5 (she left in the beginning of 5th grade). I began crushing on her back in 3rd grade but I was so disheartened when she left.

In 7th grade, I found her again on Facebook and realized that she was in the neighboring school. I friended her and talked to her (most awkward chats ever!) until I once again fell for her in 8th grade. 
 In 9th grade, it was her suite 16 (which I wasn’t invited to) took place. I still wanted to show her how much I loved her, so I sent a pendant/necklace as her birthday gift with a mutual friend of ours. I was thanked but not as much as I’d hoped.

She then became my motivation. In the end of 2015, I made a pact not to eat anything unhealthy. I promised that the next time I would eat pizza would be when it’s with her. By the end of 2016, I lost 30 kg, about a third of my initial weight - and it was all because of her.

In 2016 (10th grade), I met her for the 1st time in years. I met some of her friends too but I was so awkward and had the jitters. I made a dumb rap/poem thing that apologized for being weird.

From that time onwards, I tried asking her out (as friends) a few times, but she always had an excuse...

Nevertheless, during her next birthday, I worked alongside her sister to arrange a call from the radio station. That’s actually how I got her number. I kept the radio open that day and listened until she was called. After that, I messaged her and got a great thank you again. We then began chatting on WhatsApp...

Afterwards, I made her part my Call of Duty emblem saying “I love S”. I lied to her about it - I know, Im such an idiot. Her friends, especially this big bozo, Ekam (he’s not worth disclosing) thought it was me trying to make fun of her and decided it put me in a group chat where they said some pretty hurtful things. One of them suggested that she was his and I tried to defend her saying that she wasn’t a prize.

After a session of being roasted, I talked with her. Being the naive imbecile I was back then, I sent her screenshots, and told her that those guys were douchebags and that she should find better friends. She stopped talking to me for a couple of weeks after that, that is, until she forgave me - sort of...

Anyways, after that, it was pretty ok for a few months until came the day of reckoning. It was 11th grade. After sending her flowers that years Valentine’s Day, I was pretty confident but not enough. Nonetheless, there was a community event coming up and she was planning on going too. I had a speech I had made that I had practiced for nearly a year. It was fairly cliche but it came from my heart. I literally said it to myself every night, just before I dreamt of her and I together. My friend, let’s call her K urged me to say it there and then. In fact, earlier that day, I was given a call as I came back from some MUN training. It was an unknown caller, and when I picked up, some girl said that S was looking forward to meeting me that night. I was in absolute shock. I both believed it and didn’t at the same time. 

I could barely even speak to her under regular circumstances but I guess I felt braver that day. And so, I asked her if I could talk in private. I took her outside the tent, and I began telling her my speech. Unfortunately, it didn’t come off as expected - it was more low key and emotionless when I said it to her.

But then, at the end of the speech, I asked her out. Then came the moment I’d been waiting for for years - it was time to get the girl I had fallen in love with. But to my shock, she said that she wasn’t looking for anyone then🥺🥺. I said something around the lines of “oh ok... um ... sure” and walked away. I began crying for a few minutes while some of my friends consoled me.

After that, I went home early and tried to hide my tears from my parents. I immediately contacted her on WhatsApp, desperate to get her to rethink and say “yes”. But she didn’t. I don’t blame her though. She tried to console me by saying that not many guys are brave enough to ask a girl out like that. She even said that I’m sweet, that we could be friends and tried to put me down gently. But I couldn’t handle it - the pain of not being with her as her boyfriend...

So, I did something dumber. I went directly to Snapchat and posted an image of a graphic drawing I did of her in an attempt to get her attention. Some friends of mine told me to remove it. Looks like it made things wayyy worse. She got pissed and didn’t talk to me for weeks and weeks. Her friends sent me messages through her phone telling me that she doesn’t like me, and I eventually got blocked in Whatsapp and spent every waking moment hating myself. 

But that wasn’t the end of the story no... 

A few months later, I felt as if things had calmed down and so I contacted her via Snapchat. To my surprise, she replied. We were back to normal again - or so I thought.

Unfortunately, after some more months of awkward texts, I find out that she has a boyfriend. It’s a guy who didn’t try as hard as I did, and he already had one or two girlfriends prior.

I cried some more that night...

Also, about  a year ago, I found out that my friend, K was the one who had anonymously called that day when I was returning from MUN, and it was meant to be a prank. Then, she informed me that Ekam - that overgrown bully - had asked S to record me during my proclamation of love to her. He probably still has the recording to date.

Now, I’m just sad and lonely. I still love her but just like the song “this feeling” by the chain smokers, my friends keep telling me to forget it and move on. 

But I can’t. It’s too difficult. She’s literally the perfect girl for me. She shares my interests in math, art and oddly, pizza. She has a smile that I can never forget. Whenever I see a picture of her, I get hit by nostalgia, and can’t stop staring for a few moments, just because of her sheer beauty. 

I’ve tried but no other girl makes me tick like she does. I even noticed a correlation between my good encounters with her and my exams scores. Whenever we have a good conversation, I end up acing my exams, particularly my favourite one - Math.

I even have a folder on my laptop dedicated to all the things I did for her - the fake exam (literally three multiple choice questions, each with 4 answers that tell her how amazing she is and how she’ll ace her exams) to make her cheery before her real one, a birthday card I made using graphic design and an unpublished website that I made for her using HTML. Also, lying in my cupboard is a wristband with the words “take chances” and another necklace with her nickname engraved on it. I guess I’m still under her spell and every time I see her (especially with someone else), I either get angry or sad that I’m not there. My dreams have even been getting more and more nostalgic with nearly movie-like scenes where I end up getting the girl after going through hell. 

Looks like life’s far more real than a movie. Shocker.

Nowadays, my friends have been trying to help me talk to more girls and expand my interests. Truth is, the only reason I’m doing this is to practice any future l may have with her.

If anyone cares, she did just graduate and I’m supposed to be graduating too in a few weeks. We’ll soon be diverging to different places at college. 

I don’t know if it’ll ever work out between us, but I’ll keep trying. 

I love her ♥️

Im sorry for this awful rant that may or may not have wasted minutes of your life. And I know that some of you may think I’m a monster, while others may consider me a victim - but at this point, I don’t care who or what I am. I just care about her.

She moved abroad for a year for a contract job but has plans to stay there for the foreseeable future. It has been her dream for a long time. Her life was miserable here and she was depressed a lot. Neither of us really had any friends except each other but we were a great couple and our love was so strong. I was there for her and she was for me even though I wasn't really depressed.

The first month she was gone I was fine. She was just settling in her new place and was trying to make friends. We talked often and she would update me on everything. Slowly the calls and messages became less frequent. Then eventually at the end of March we talked out our feelings. Long story short, she decided to end our relationship. Not because she didnt love me anymore but because it felt like she didn't have a boyfriend. 
It has been a few weeks and I'm just a broken mess right now. I used to have her constant attention and love all the time. We didnt live together but we talked to each other everyday. Our constant communication and affection was what made our relationship so great. We would see each other every weekend and it was the greatest feeling in the world to see her after a long week. Now I don't hear from her much. She's always either going out with her new friends or busy with work. I understand though. She has a new life and is still figuring it out over there. I understand but it still hurts. 

I always spent the weekends with her but I havent done anything ever since she left. I've been crying uncontrollably so much. Even at work I have to hold back my tears some days. I've never cried so much as I did in the past few weeks. She knows I'm hurt and she feels guilty leaving me behind but it was to pursue her dream. I can't blame her for that. I would never ask her to give up her dreams just to be with me. It would be selfish. It truly warms my heart to see her finally happy but now I feel so alone and abandoned. We are on good terms and I want to talk to her about this so bad but I can't bring myself to do it. I don't want her to worry about me. I just want her to be happy but suffering in silence is so painful. 

I thought I was stronger but I'm not. My body feels weak sometimes and my appetite hasn't really been the same. I hate my job and now I dread the weekends because it just reminds me of that I lost. I feel like I've really reached the lowest point in my life and I don't know what to do anymore.

I was ready for suicide one night, and she was there for me. she had a bf at the time but i fell for her, and i fell hard. Soon, her bf started drifting away and she ended that relationship. A few days later i asked her out. She said yes. I was so happy for days, even weeks. It has been a month and a half since we started dating but i had serious feeling for the past 3 years and she told me that she had a serious crush on me too. Even that she was about to ask me out prolly a day after i did. We havent even had a single argument. We like to sent 200-500 word messages of how we feel for eachother almost everyday. Since 3 days ago we started on a major one. We both started typing and they broke 3000 words easily. When we both sent, opened, and read eachother's messages, we both broke down crying because of how sweet and meaningful our messages were. The last time i cried that hard was when my uncle had a serious heart attack, he was without a heartbeat for 20 mins. I was almost sure we would lose him. God answered all of our prayers by bringing him back without a speck of brain damage. Anyways, she posted on her snap story and one friend of hers replied that if i were to break her hear (which i wont) he wouldnt be there for her. He basically dropped her as a friend because she loves me. He made her cry because it was a long friendship ended because of his stupidity. She refused to give me his number or his snap because she knew i would beat the hell out of him. Then she stopped crying. He was talking shit about me.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the girls in the world are complaining about it

Most of the poems in the world have been written about it

Most of the music on the radio is kicking about it, ripping about it, or spitting about it

Most of the verses in the game people are talking about it

Most of the broken hearts I know are walking without it, started to doubt it, or lost without it

Most of the shadows in the dark have forgotten about it

Everybody in the world will be tripping without it

Every boy and every girl will be dead without it, struggle without it, nothing without it

Most of the fingers that are drunk are dialling about it

Most of the people that are in it are smiling about it

Most of the people that have felt it are crying about it, or trying to get it back or lying about it

Most of the pages that are filled are filled about it

The tears that are spilled are spilled about it

The people that have felt it are real about it

A life without it, you’d be lost without it

When I am in it, and I feel it, I’d be shouting about it

Everybody in the whole world knowing about it

I’m hurt and broke down, I’d be flowing about it

Going about it wrong because I didn’t allow it

You see, cannot a wound or scar heal without it

Can’t the way that you feel be concealed about it

Everybody has their own ideal about it, dream about it, appeal about it

So what’s the deal about it?

Are you bound about it to know that life is a trip and unreal about it?

Everything that you feel is surreal about it

But I’m just a writer, so what can I reveal about it?

I'm in love with my best friend, whom I've known for 8 years now. She's the most amazing person ever! We've known each other from online, and we have been chatting almost every day for 8 years now. Long distance. The kicker is, I've only met her twice.

4.5 years ago, I got asked out by someone else and the very thought not being able to text my bestie daily freaked me out. That's when I realized how much I liked my best friend and ""asked her out"" even though we lived on separate continents. She said that she likes me too but wasn't ready for a relationship with anybody at that moment. She asked me to wait until she was ready and said it's okay if I choose not to. I chose to wait for her, over the years we've been chatting as per usual, texting her is the best part of my day. I live faaar away from family and my work life is such that i don't really have the time to eat/sleep. Whatever limited time I can free up, I free up to text her. So, I never really had any time to invest in anybody else as a friend. \*Not in a relationship with her yet\*

She's also moved to the same country as mine and I am STOKED that we're finally in the same time zone, let alone anything else. Over these 4.5 years, my feelings for have only increased. She knows it, we've talked about it, I told her forget being in a relationship, I wanna marry her. She too says that she can see a future with me, but needs to get her parents' approval first (Yeah, that's sadly how it works in our culture). I was like, cool. But then, I was hit with a ""I don't want to bring it up until they ask me"", which I completely understand. I've known people to turn down their child's request and have them married to someone else. I didn't want to rush her if she's not ready. \*Not in a relationship with her yet\*

I went to meet her two years ago, had fun time watching movies and going out to eat and doing fun activities and what not. She told me that she wanted to take things slow as it was weird to meet someone you've been texting for so long and out of the blue just meet them physically. I respect her privacy and her opinion. The same thing happened the year after. But, like I said, she's the most amazing person I know. I know that she's someone I want to spend the rest of my life with, someone I'd be super proud of as a spouse, etc etc. \*Not in a relationship with her yet\*

Over these 4.5 years, I've been longing for some love and affection, let alone anything else. I don't have friends where I live. I haven't seen family in five years. I have a best friend whom I'd lose my very limited sleep for to just text her and she knows it. But I know she doesn't do the same. And she admitted that it's ""selfish""of her to do so, but it is what it is (her words, not mine). It killed me when she used the word ""selfish"" but I know that waiting for her is going to be worth it. I don't receive any compliments from her, she doesn't flirt with me, she doesn't say anything nice unless I point it out and it makes me feel like I'm begging her to say something good and I feel HORRIBLE every time I do so. Feels like I'm losing my self-respect by asking, but you know how it means the world to you when someone important says something nice about you, right? She says that any reciprocation from her is only going to lead me on and will hurt me more if her parents disapprove of me. And I understand that. \*Not in a relationship with her yet\*

A couple months back, she agreed to be in a relationship, after 4.5 years of me waiting for her. And nothing seems to have changed, except that ""are in a relationship"". She says that she can't meet because she has other priorities but will try to make time for me. Her parents talked about how their relatives have been asking her why she isn't married yet, and she didn't tell them about me, maybe she's waiting to meet them in person, I don't know.I'm beginning to think that she doesn't really want to be with me, I've asked her that, she says I'm stupid and I need to not think too much. But it's been hurting me for so long. Over the past 5 years, I got asked out by a bunch of other women and decided to not act on any of that because I'm waiting for someone else. But I'm old AF now, on my way to looking like Jeff Bezos (minus all the Jeff Bezos money and a jacked up body. )

I don't know what to do, I don't have friends and I can't talk to anyone else, because she's my go to person. Life has been VERY tough outside of all this and I'm beginning to lose hope that this ""relationship"" is going to go anywhere, no matter how hard I try. It's very lonely and there has not been any love or affection towards me from anybody in the best part of the past decade. I feel like I'm giving and giving and that's about it. It's exhausting but I have belief that it's all going to be worth it. I'm bawling my eyes out as I type this out and i don't know what the future holds. I've waited for so long, waiting for some more time isn't gonna hurt. But that's what I've been telling myself for almost five years now and it HAS been hurting. And yet, I want to be hopeful that it's all gonna be worth it.

This may be the only time I ever post here, and I plan to make it count.


I am making this post because, once upon a time, I didn't believe in romantic love. I didn't want kids, and I felt that I would be alright on my own -  for all time, if need be. I saw human relationships as nothing more than a spectrum, with the top of that spectrum representing what people called ""love"". I didn't think there was anything that really differentiated it from ""really really liking someone"" apart from it being a slightly stronger emotion, and honestly I saw it as being kind of an arbitrary thing; more of a story people told themselves (and eachother) than an actual emotional experience.


Now I know different. What follows is my personal experience of falling in love with the woman who would become my fiancee: what it felt like, how long it took, and how it differed from what I expected. I am posting this in the hopes that someone who has never experienced romantic love, (especially those who are cynical about it like I used to be) will read it and understand that it's not just a lie or a social construct or whatever people wish to handwave it away as - love is real, and it happened to me.


With all that said, here is my TL;DR description of romantic love: Love is a *trip*


Now here's the long version:


When I met my fiancee for the first time, I was instantly intrigued. She was quiet, shy, and nerdy like me, but by the end of that first meeting we were already chatting and joking around with eachother. I think I was too cynical and inexperienced with relationships at the time to have that ""love at first sight"" feeling, but I knew one thing: I cared about what she thought of me more than anyone I'd ever met before.


After that meeting we did a lot of stuff together. We played online games together, chatted over Facebook, and had our first few dates. It's during this time that I began to experience something that I hadn't felt in any other relationship, and I don't know of any name for it so I'll just try to describe it as best I can:


Basically, I would have this recurring feeling of ""sameness"" between us. On a superficial level I think this is common during the honeymoon phase of many relationships, (""You like peanut butter OH WOW ME TOO WE'RE LIKE THE SAME"") but what I am describing was persistent, and *powerful* - like, almost to the point where I thought I was going a little nutty.


It would happen most often when we were talking about our ideas about morals, society, life, our childhood, etc. In many cases our thoughts and experiences mirrored eachother so perfectly that I'd be taken aback, sometimes to the point where I would literally wake up wondering if I'd dreamed her up or was hallucinating some aspect of my own psyche A Beautiful Mind-style. Obviously this was not the case and that feeling of unreality diminished with time, but that feeling of being scarily similar as people never went away entirely.


The next big indicator that I was experiencing love was the transformative impact it had on my life. In the five years that followed our meeting, I basically had a total turnaround: I grew less cynical, more friendly, more willing to try new things, and in general I just became a way happier person. It didn't feel like work, either; she just brought out the best in me, and that continues to this day. If I had to make an analogy, it would be that of being a fish in a freshly-cleaned tank - in what felt like no time at all, my life was filled with so much joy, clarity, and passion that I could scarcely understand what had even happened or how it had been accomplished.


This leads me to the final trait of my experience with romantic love: bewilderment. Many years after meeting my fiancee I quite literally feel like a different person, and it's all because I had a person who loved and understood me. At the time this made no sense to me; I had only ever been alone aside from a few underwhelming relationships, and before all this the only way I knew how to grow as a person was to struggle and push myself. I never imagined that such positive, drastic changes could occur in my life just by spending lots of time with a person who is a delight to be around. At the time this was counter to everything I understood about self-improvement, which led me to my final conclusion about love:


I think love is elusive to so many people because it's pure emotion. In many ways it defies understanding and logic, and I think that's one of the telltale signs that it might be happening to you. It has made me feel like I'm going crazy, it has transformed my perspective on the world and my passions in life, and it has given me more strength and happiness than I ever thought I'd be able to muster within myself... And even now, I only feel slightly better-equipped to explain it than I was when I first met my fiancee. But I hope that this post has helped someone understand romantic love a little better nonetheless, or at the very least, provided all of you who have made it this far with some feels or entertainment.


Thank you for reading, and I wish all of you the same luck in love that I have found.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, friends. This may be the only time I ever post here, and I plan to make it count.&lt;/p&gt;

On a superficial level I think this is common during the honeymoon phase of many relationships, (&amp;quot;You like peanut butter OH WOW ME TOO WE&amp;#39;RE LIKE THE SAME&amp;quot;) but what I am describing was persistent, and &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; - like, almost to the point where I thought I was going a little nutty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would happen most often when we were talking about our ideas about morals, society, life, our childhood, etc. In many cases our thoughts and experiences mirrored eachother so perfectly that I&amp;#39;d be taken aback, sometimes to the point where I would literally wake up wondering if I&amp;#39;d dreamed her up or was hallucinating some aspect of my own psyche A Beautiful Mind-style. Obviously this was not the case and that feeling of unreality diminished with time, but that feeling of being scarily similar as people never went away entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next big indicator that I was experiencing love was the transformative impact it had on my life. In the five years that followed our meeting, I basically had a total turnaround: I grew less cynical, more friendly, more willing to try new things, and in general I just became a way happier person. It didn&amp;#39;t feel like work, either; she just brought out the best in me, and that continues to this day. If I had to make an analogy, it would be that of being a fish in a freshly-cleaned tank - in what felt like no time at all, my life was filled with so much joy, clarity, and passion that I could scarcely understand what had even happened or how it had been accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to the final trait of my experience with romantic love: bewilderment. Many years after meeting my fiancee I quite literally feel like a different person, and it&amp;#39;s all because I had a person who loved and understood me. At the time this made no sense to me; I had only ever been alone aside from a few underwhelming relationships, and before all this the only way I knew how to grow as a person was to struggle and push myself. I never imagined that such positive, drastic changes could occur in my life just by spending lots of time with a person who is a delight to be around. At the time this was counter to everything I understood about self-improvement, which led me to my final conclusion about love:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think love is elusive to so many people because it&amp;#39;s pure emotion. In many ways it defies understanding and logic, and I think that&amp;#39;s one of the telltale signs that it might be happening to you. It has made me feel like I&amp;#39;m going crazy, it has transformed my perspective on the world and my passions in life, and it has given me more strength and happiness than I ever thought I&amp;#39;d be able to muster within myself... And even now, I only feel slightly better-equipped to explain it than I was when I first met my fiancee. But I hope that this post has helped someone understand romantic love a little better nonetheless, or at the very least, provided all of you who have made it this far with some feels or entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, and I wish all of you the same luck in love that I have found.&lt;/p&gt;

How i got together with my boyfriend ( i love him so much, gaahhdd)

Unfortunately i got together with him because of something sad happened. Almost none of my previous relations has been good, i was too naive to..innocent...i just wanted to love someone because i didn't get to experience much love ever in my life, i gave everything for my partner and did everything for her/him (yes im Pan). I really got to see the dark side of people like my 1st Boyfriend, my first ever relationship and he insulted me was angry at me and toxic it wad bad and quickly ended.

After that i got together with a girl, she was hurt, she was nice and only wanted to love, just like me, we talked for a bit and got together after a while, i loved her a lot but quickly noticed she was...she was pretty toxic, again aggressive towards me, she wouldn't let me have any friends, NOTHING😭😭 i thought ""what am i doing wrong, what is my problem"" i broke up with her because she was hammering down on me, every day, every night, i have other mental issues and i couldn't take it so i...broke contact, i couldn't take it anymore(lately we came in contact again, its all normal again, except the big scar i have from her(mental scar)).

After that i looked back at it and decided to...keep on trying...keep on looking for the true love...the person i can share my life with and love...be dedicated to and look forward to every day.

I thought i found this someone, he was nice...understanding and realistic...it was very quickly very obvious that i had a decent crush on him and i loved him like crazy, nothing could break my love for him...well...almost nothing. He could...and he did...i thought i could spend the rest of my life with him, he wasn't as irrational as the other ones but...maybe he was? He betrayed me multiple times....cheated on me...and told me about everything...its even worse when the person you love the most over everyone tells you how he made out with another guy, i cried for days...hour after hour, i wanted to forgive him....i loved him still and thought that i can handle it, i couldn't...i just couldn't ...around 1 month i knew my bf and was together with him(the cheater) i found friends and under them one especially amazing one. He always listened to me...he was always nice and understanding and even greatful that i talked with him...he had a boyfriend though and i didn't even think of a relationship with him...i just want one constant relationship full of love and affection, something my current cheaty bf couldn't give me...he was too busy to hang out his...well...his local bf...or..his..other(?) bf.
i really don't know how to describe it...well he was like ""oop gotta go, gonna meet my bf""
after that kind of message i started to cry,ni was till in the process of wanting to forgive him and...i couldn't as said...after that i broke up with him..i had enough...i didn't want anymore..i wasn't single long and this amazing friend confessed his love to me.....he broke up with his bf because he kinda cheated on him too, not going into detail,. He confessed, to me...i obviously had a crush on him for about a week now...im not someone that has a lot of relationships, but i wanted to do everything to find the right one. So we got together...my life since then has improved by a lot...i love him every day even more and he is my motivation to keep going. We have been together for about 2 months by now, and ...im still as happy as on the first day, i would do everuthing for him and he is no jerk, not toxic..not embarrassed about my disorders...nothing..
he is exactly who i want and he wants me...im in true love.

To wrap this up...this is a quite all over the place story, if you managed to understand it, congratulations....if not  its okay.
At the end of the day my message is for everyone that is heartbroken, has been cheated on or is unhappy.
Don't hesitate to do everything to make you happy, because life is too short to be unhappy, i am happy...now its your turn.
❤️😍😘 Everyone have a great day!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So i will tell a little story here, just to maybe express some feelingsor just to be able to look at it and think &amp;quot;yes...thats me&amp;quot;, this is written on phone though so it could have some spelling errors.&lt;/p&gt;

i really don&amp;#39;t know how to describe it...well he was like &amp;quot;oop gotta go, gonna meet my bf&amp;quot;
after that kind of message i started to cry,ni was till in the process of wanting to forgive him and...i couldn&amp;#39;t as said...after that i broke up with him..i had enough...i didn&amp;#39;t want anymore..i wasn&amp;#39;t single long and this amazing friend confessed his love to me.....he broke up with his bf because he kinda cheated on him too, not going into detail,. He confessed, to me...i obviously had a crush on him for about a week now...im not someone that has a lot of relationships, but i wanted to do everything to find the right one. So we got together...my life since then has improved by a lot...i love him every day even more and he is my motivation to keep going. We have been together for about 2 months by now, and ...im still as happy as on the first day, i would do everuthing for him and he is no jerk, not toxic..not embarrassed about my disorders...nothing..
he is exactly who i want and he wants me...im in true love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap this up...this is a quite all over the place story, if you managed to understand it, congratulations....if not  its okay.
At the end of the day my message is for everyone that is heartbroken, has been cheated on or is unhappy.
Don&amp;#39;t hesitate to do everything to make you happy, because life is too short to be unhappy, i am happy...now its your turn.
❤️😍😘 Everyone have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

I know I would make someone very happy and lucky and I don&amp;#39;t know why it just doesn&amp;#39;t want to go right for me. I see all these jerks with girls who claim that they don&amp;#39;t like that kind of guy and yet here I am and here they are. I&amp;#39;ve never really put these words out there and im not even sure I expressed how im feeling clearly. I just need a bone thrown my way, some kind of sign to tell me that it&amp;#39;s in my near future. Im not looking for my wife right now but being lonely isn&amp;#39;t fun either.&lt;/p&gt;

I am seriously so madly in love with my boyfriend it's crazy! 

He is so wonderful, I can't even go into all of it. Let me instead share a moment that made my heart melt.

&amp;#x200B;

We were at the farmer's market this past weekend. It was a gorgeous sunny day and we were there with a friend of his. We decided to park our butts on the curb and listen to a guitarist that was playing there. So we sat and listened to him play for quite awhile. It was fun!!! After he finished playing and the market was closing up, it was time to get our butts off the curb. Egg (bf) stood up first, and then I just put my hand in the air towards him. He grabbed my hand and helped me get up. I said, ""Aww thank you cutie!"" he was like ""Ya, I always got your back!"" \*heart melting, boy I love is so amazing....Anime twinkly eyes here\*

&amp;#x200B;

This might seem really small, but my God, he effing makes my heart melt. He'll just say things like that all the time, and he really means it. This isn't some bullshit he's saying, he's damn genuine.

&amp;#x200B;

Another moment...okay bonus for y'all still reading. We were on a hike, again with his friend, and we're strolling along. Suddenly, I feel his hand in mine...\*swoon\* He looks over at me and smiles!!! Omgerrrrddddd, is he real???

We hiked to the top of this gorgeous vista point which overlooks the Bay. I can't tell you how hard I had to fight the urge to make out with him. The only reason I didn't was because I didn't want to make his friend feel uncomfortable. But picture this....you're with the person you love, starring out at a gorgeous view, and you're surrounded by a beautiful meadow. Holy glorb, I had to lock my shit up so tight. Later on when we were texting he told me he really had to resist the urge to makeout with me as well, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Efffssssss, I love him, I love him, I love him!!! Damn it hasn't been that long since we defined the relat, and became official on March 10 aka Mar10 Day, yusssssssss!!! But I feel incredibly strongly towards him. I said it in a previous post, I want to marry him. I seriously do. I'm done wasting time, I've found someone that loves me and gets my weird soul, I have zero desire to look elsewhere. Where will this love lead...no one knows....

And I got hurt a lot of times- and I blame myself for it and nobody else: I simply fall in love too quickly. 

So what happened in the past 3 months is the main thing here: There’s been this guy that we have been friends for 3 years already. I liked him from the very start but somehow nothing happened. He is more of a quiet person, maybe that’s why he didn’t approach me. But a few months ago my bestfriend talked with him and he confessed he’s mad about me from the day we met.  That’s why she even encouraged him to approach me. And he did. And after I dumbed my “friend with benefits” we finally got on a date.  But things have been moving so slow ( I’m really not used to that- I’m more of a humping rabbit on a first date only then comes love if ever🤷‍♀️)

We made out for the first time fee weeks ago, and only it came to this in one month . I just started to get bored. But he’s so cute and he’s treating me like no one ever did. He kisses me on my forehead and holds my hand. I feel like a teenager. And a phrase that’s repeating in my head all the time: “ I just love being with you and nobody else.” 
What happened last weekend was even stranger for me. I slept over at his place , but we didn’t have sex.  When we woke up we kept on cuddling for hours and our legs and arms being wrapped around each other. He was looking at me and told me I’m cute. Oh my heart was screaming when he said that. Maybe it was that moment that I started to be really attracted to him(not that I haven’t been just a little before , but I was more passive until now. ) . 

Now we’re both very busy and can’t see each other everyday. I can’t wait to see him again, but I haven’t heard from him  for a day.  Now I’m at work struggling again with this thought: HAVE I FALLEN AGAIN TOO QUICKLY? Please no. It can’t be.
I’m embarrassed to tell anyone about it,  it sounds silly to me falling in love because someone said I’m cute or because we’ve been on couple of dates. And I’m also afraid even this wasn’t all real or that I screwed up something again. 

And I don’t even know why I’m writing this but it just seemed to be the right thing to do now, since I don’t want to talk about it with anyone.

In 7th grade girls were way more than boys. With the newcommer girls the diffrence became bigger. So lets get to the story. One of the newcommers is pretty cute and a nerd. So the nerd was cute and everybody (including me) had a crush on her. We were good friends with her. Everytime we see eachother at school we do this punch-handshake kindof thing and say ""hey bro!"". It was a good frienship until...
I was at the cafeteria line and talking to my friends about brawl stars( a moba game that is fun). She came running to me.
Me: hey bro! ( i readied my hand for the handshake cuz she always starts the handshake)
She didnt do the handshake. I was confused beacause the handshake is the crutial point of our frienship.
S ( im gonna call her s) : i need to talk to you!
Me: can it wait until we have lunch? (I was mad at her cuz she didnt do the handshake)
S: no it cant i need to talk to you NOW!
Me: why dont you tell me what you want while eating lunch?
S: no we need to talk NOW! (She was screaming)
I can get very embaressed in public so i got a little mad at her for embarresing me.
Me: OK fine but keep it quick okay?
S: okay. ( she looked happy cuz i accepted to talk to her)
We exited the cafeteria. She was walking pretty fast. I told her to slow down. 
S: no we need to be quick!
Me: besides where are we going?
S: somewhere special...
She held my hand and walked faster. As a kid i was shocked that she held my hand cuz at oir school teachers are very strick about phisical contact. I was afraid if somebody would see us beacause if somebody sees me with her i would DIE!
She took me to the -1st floor. I have only been there once and its VERY DARK!
Me: ok is this the place ""special"". And besides why didnt you do the handshake? Its important to me as your friend.
She looked like she was about to cry. I tried to cheer her up and put my hand on her shoulder. It was very hard to do that cuz im practically scared of most girl cuz i got beaten up by alot of girls.
S: that isnt the point!
Me: than what is the point?
S: i dont want to be friends with you anymore!
That was what hit me. I was sad and mad.
Me: if you dont want to be friends with me anymore, why would you do this here! I could have ate lunch instead of messing with this bullshit!
I think i have gone too far beacause she started to cry.
Me: uh... sorry i didnt mean it. Im sorry S. But where did this come from?
S (while crying): you didnt get me right! I want to be more than friends! I love you...
I was shocked ALOT. I had no idea what to do cuz i only had one girlfriend until that time.
Me: whaaaaaa? Did i get that right?
S: yes! (While crying)
Me: i love you too...
S looked at me and cryed even worse.
Me: there is nothing to cry, love is natural... ( i was talking like i had alot of expeirience at love)
S: im crying of happieness! I have loved you since the beggining of the year! Would you be my boyfriend?!
Me: yes but...
S: but what!?
Me: we need to have a few rules at our relationship. First of all: we cant tell ANYBODY about this. Second of all: we cant do this love thing at school, the teachers would KILL us.
S: i agree...
We went up to the cafeteria after talking for 15 minutes. My friends were waiting for me while eating their food. When i sat at the table they were sitting. They looked at me like they knew EVERYTHING. We didnt talk about this ""talk"" thing. We just kept talking about brawl stars.
After that we have done our relationship via phone and had a date every week. A few of my friends noticed that a ""thing"" was going on. S's friends noticed a few thing about us too but not everything.
I will post more stories of our relationship. I hoped you enjoyed my story.

never thought i’d fall for someone so hard and so quick but he is ... different. my mind wanders to him randomly throughout the day. i think about his quirks and love his flaws. i feel myself growing more and more comfortable in his presence. i don’t feel like i need to hide my darkest and weakest spots or my insecurities around him, i can just be my true raw self. 
when i’m with him, i feel like i’m at peace. at home. 
when i’m with him, i laugh at his stupid, un funny jokes and he laughs at mine. when i’m with him, i forget about my depression and enjoy the moment and enjoy life for what it is. 
he cares so much for me and doesn’t expect anything in return. 
he’s sleeping next to me as we speak, i can’t sleep because i’ve been thinking about this all night. how i think i’m in love but too afraid to say it to him. 
seeing him is easily the best part of my day. and when he’s not there, i miss him dearly. 
our relationship has come out of an awful circumstance (my parents not wanting us to be together, so we date in secret). 
and i think everything i feel for him grows stronger despite the circumstances. 
i’m afraid, though, that we will drift apart. i’m afraid i don’t know what the future holds. i’m afraid my parents will make us break up (again). i don’t think i can imagine my life without him anymore. 
he holds such a special place in my heart and makes me so happy. he inspires me and gives me room to grow and wants the best for me. i don’t know if he loves me back the way i think i love him. but his actions speak much more than his words (or lack thereof) do. 
2 months have flown by and we’ve learned and grown so much since. i hope this is just the start of love because it is so wholesome and so beautiful. 
if this is what love is, i want it forever.
what about you reddit? how do you know when you’re in love?

I had prepared to wake up 3 hours before to work on some aspects of the exam material that were giving me issues. Conveniently, my alarm did not go off and I sat straight up in bed 30 minutes before the test. My panic woke my girlfriend up, and she immediately told me to relax, and that she would drive me to my test so that I didn’t have to worry about parking (which could take 15 minutes or more). This allowed me to get myself together and not show up in a state of panic. 

She rolls out of bed and puts on some lounge shorts and a t-shirt, slips on her shoes, and we head out. I get to class and proceed to print out my take home portion of the test (worth 50% of the final exam), but when I try to access my google drive, it notifies me that I need to check my phone for the verification code. I reach for my phone. Not there. I had left it in my girlfriends car. I went to my teacher in a panic and he graciously said I could print it after the test if it would be quick.  At this point I’m thankful, but wonder how I am going to get in touch with my girlfriend to get my phone. She had stated that she would be waiting nearby in her car waiting on me to finish my test, but I couldn’t call or text her. I decided that I could not afford to worry/stress during this exam so I mentally put it aside and began my exam. 

As I exited the class wondering how I was going to get in touch with her, I saw her sitting in the chair outside my class waiting on me with my phone. I was in amazement. There were copious amounts of students all around (a lot that we know and see all the time), and she is sitting in front of my class looking like she just rolled out of bed. In my opinion, this is when she is the most beautiful to me. But to her, I know that she is self conscious about how she looks before she’s all ready, and for her to put that aside and track me down when she didn’t know what classroom I was in in a building of 600 rooms, amazed me. Not to mention she’s under the pressure of her own exams and had to be at work later that day. She could have slept, she could have given verbal support, she could have made those 3 hours way easier on herself, but she chose to make them easier for me.

I went on over 20+ dates. I only had a second date once, and after I thought everything went so well, he told me he was no longer interested.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety since I was 15, and dating was already difficult enough. After that last date, I didn’t feel comfortable going on any after that. I was so sure that I was destined to be alone (I’m only 22, so yeah, that was naive).

I was tired of men. I’d been on dates where the men had insulted my work, my appearance, I experienced a sexual assault on one, and I was just genuinely downtrodden. So I vowed that I’d stop looking.

I deleted all of my dating apps, cleared my mind, and started focusing more on myself and my work/schooling.

And then, right as I’d given up: I was talking to my female coworker (kind of like a second mother to me) about how cute our other coworker was in his work pants, haha. Of course, she told him. I didn't think much of it until my phone lit up one afternoon in the middle of class and it was him. 

We talked all day. We talked about our politics, about school, work, his hobbies and mine: and then he suggested we go to coffee to talk more. That's when we really hit it off. He was into all of the same hobbies but had hobbies of his own as well. Our political opinions were similar, our upbringings were both full of surprises, and everything was just... comfortable.

Fast forward to the end of the first date—we walked into my apartment and he immediately saw my empty IKEA furniture boxes that I had yet to put together.

“Do you want some help with these?”

I never believed in any sort of love before that moment. But now I had a man in front of me that was seriously offering to help me tackle the Mount Everest of furniture assembly.

That was the moment I knew I loved him.

Since that day 5 months ago, I've fallen more in love with him every day.

He's helped me build IKEA furniture (a task that is worthy of love in the first place), he's encouraged me to work on my hobbies and gives me tips/tricks to improve while he works alongside me. He recently lost his mom and he communicated his feelings throughout the entire thing and he lets me know when he needs something. 

He not only makes me want to be a better person, but he does so without tearing down the person I am now.

While he's already swept me off of my feet by this point, the most heartwarming thing happened recently.

My roommates had suddenly decided they no longer want to live with me after our lease is up in July. This left me only a few months to scramble and find another apartment, while having very little savings.

I needed someone to rant to and had just happened to complain about it to my partner, and without hesitation: he suggested that I move in with him.

And so, the second the lease is over, I'll finally be moving into a place with the person I love.

We've started saving money and have a little bit saved already and we don't even move in until August! We've been so excited. We talk about filling the place with hanging plants and flowers, how we'll be cooking meals together in an effort to become healthier, and I am just so fucking \*happy\*. 

I never thought that I would love someone so fiercely, but here I am. I may not know what the future holds, but as long as he's in it, I think it'll all be okay.

My Ex and I have always been in contact and though we don't see one another anymore. We still are in contact every week. After about 3 years.

We both admitted this, and talk about it sometimes. Wishing we could go back, before you all say. Yes, this is bad.

As much as we think about eachother and still love one another, we know it'll never work with what's went on. We would never cheat and don't see eachother anyway, it's just frustrating and we are both struggling to get on with our lives. We have tried time apart, deleting eachother, trying to move on.

The problem is this: I met a guy on a date site. We started chatting on Facebook, we got similar personalities and ideas, we are mentally connected.
There's just one thing: he's... not that attractive. 
Before you think I'm a random selfish person that only look for good looks in people, let me tell you this: I already tried to have a relationship with someone I was mentally attracted but not physically and it didn't work. Every time I had even to kiss him, I had to pretend he had another face and body in order not to feel disgusted. After a while, I just left him: it wasn't right for me and for him to pretend I liked him in every way.
